**_SCHEDULE OF ASSIGNMENTS_**

    Each week addresses a specific topic. The format of each seminar includes a lecture, an oral report, assigned readings for discussion, and an occasional map exercise. 

**_(1) Lecture Topics:_**  
              Cf. separate page for the lecture topics. 

**_(2)   Oral reports:_**  
              Beginning with the second week, a student will be assigned to give an oral report on a specific topic [cf. assignment sheet for your topic and assigned date]. In preparing for that report, the assigned student will meet with me sometime during the week prior to his/her report to discuss the content, organization, & analysis of the topic. In preparing for this report the student should also make an outline with copies for each participant in the seminar. 

**_(3) Assigned readings:_**  
              Each week the participants in the seminar will receive a page of assigned readings from the required books and the photocopied articles [on reserve in the Library], along with questions for the discussion period. These reading assignments will be given out the week prior to the discussion date, e.g., the first week of the seminar students will receive the reading assignment & questions due on the second week, etc. This will give the students time [one week] to prepare for an intelligent discussion of the topic.   
              Since you will encounter many unfamiliar names & terms in the readings & lectures, a list of "identifications" will be included in the weekly assignment sheets. Important geographic terms will appear in the map exercises. 

**_(4) Map exercise:_**  
              One cannot understand the complex nature of Balkan history without an understanding of the geography. There will be several map exercises for the purpose of familiarizing the students not only with the geography, but also the impact that geography has had on the history,& culture, of the Balkan countries and population. 

**_(5) Term Paper:_**  
               Cf. separate page of instructions for the Term paper.   
    


**_TOPICS FOR THE ORAL REPORT:_**

**_Note:_** You are to see me **the week before** presenting your report. The
Lecture text you received is to serve as a guideline, **not as your report**.
In preparing for this report you are expected  to have used **FOUR** other
sources.

**_Term Paper Instructions_**

**_I._**      The Term Paper will require you to read & compare several
historical treatments of a controversial episode or ideas. This does not mean
restating a factual narrative; it means comparing or critiquing versions of
the truth as offered by various historians. E.g., a paper could be written
about the differing interpretations concerning the Serbian claims to Kosovo by
the opposing parties.  In this case you would analyze the arguments of both
sides, i.e., Serbian historians' views vs. those of Albanian historians.

    Another example would be the claims of atrocities by the Ustashi vs. those of the Chetniks in World War II. Both sides accuse the other of enormous atrocities What arguments do the historians of each position offer to support their charges vs. the other? How valid are they, etc. 

    There are also interesting controversies about the interpretation of ideas like ethno-religious nationalism; a comparison of Ottoman to Habsburg rule in the Balkans; other foreign influences in Balkan politics, etc. The topics covered in the Seminar are also a useful source for a Term Paper subject. 

**_II.      Further instructions:_**  
    (a) The term paper should be from 10 - 12 pages in length, including bibliography. Footnotes are   
         separate, either at the bottom of the page or at the end of the paper before the bibliography. 

    (b) Title page: title of the paper in the center with Name, History 520.01 below it, and date below that   
         in the right hand corner of the page. Be sure you paginate the paper, but do not include your name   
        on any other page except the title page. Electronic versions (e-mail or e-mail attachments, Faxes, etc.)   
        are not acceptable under any circumstances. 

    (c)  Use the Kate L. Turabian: _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, & Dissertations_   
          (6th edition, U. of Chicago Press, 1996), or _MLA Style Sheet_ (located near Reference Desk   
          in the Library). In either case be consistent. I will also be of assistance concerning the format   
         or any other questions you may have concerning the paper. 

    (d)  Since good writing like good wine is the result of careful  cultivation, you are to meet with me to   
          discuss the following issues according to the following deadlines: 

**(1) FEBRUARY   11th :**      Term paper topic along with FOUR preliminary
sources. (5 Points)  
**(2) MARCH         13th:**       An annotated bibliography (cf. sample below)
including at least FOUR  
                                             annotated sources. (5 points)   
**(3) MARCH         28th:**       A 2-3 page outline of the paper, including a
thesis statement  
                                             & a draft of the  first paragraph. (5 points)   
**(4) APRIL            22nd:       **First draft due (15 points.)  
**(5) MAY                3rd.    **    Final paper due [ worth 40% of the
course grade.]  
*******************************************************************  
**Note on Plagerism:  ** Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines plagerism:
_to steal & pass off [the ideas_  
_                                   or words of another] as one's own without
crediting the source._  In this course  
                                 the penalty for plagerism is an **F**.

**_Sample of annotated bibliography:_**

Bell , John D.   _Peasants in Power: Alexander Stambolski and the_  
       _Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, 1899-1923.  _ Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1977. 

    Explains that the Agrarian leader Alexander Stambolski dealt with several problems in the beginning of his rule, primarily the national problem. Truncated after World War I, and rendered helpless after the Treaty of Neuilly of 1919, Bulgaria resented the Great Powers, but also her neighbors, all of whom, except Turkey, had profited by the war. Claims that Stambolski's novel ideas of Balkan peace and understanding, and especially the notion of close cooperation and friendship with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, almost inevitably clashed with the sentiments of the more nationalistic Bulgarians.

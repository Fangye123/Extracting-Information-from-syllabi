  _ **Cultural Anthropology**_

Cultural anthropology is the study of living human beings in our own and other
societies.  It attempts to understand what it means to be human by exploring
the uniformity and diversity of cultures.  This course will be organized
around the concept of stratification--institutionalized inequality.  We will
examine how stratification by sex, race, and class affects human life and
potential.  We will give particular attention to how institutionalized
inequality influences gender relations, self-concept, life chances, and
material well-being.  Our examination of stratification will take place
through the study and comparison of four cultural groups.  We will begin with
the life-history of Nisa, a member of the relatively egalitarian hunting-
gathering Bushmen of Southern Africa.  We will then look at the classless but
"mythically male dominant" Mundurucu Indians of the Brazilian Amazon Basin.
Next we will examine how poverty affects the life chances and hopes of the
underclass of Naples, Italy.  Finally, we will look at race, class, and gender
in the great Arizona mine strike of 1983 in Chicano communities of
southeastern Arizona.  Throughout the course we will examine what forms
inequality takes  and what effects it has in different cultural settings.  We
will also examine how anthropologists work, learn, and think about people in
diverse cultures.  We will explore anthropological fieldwork and conduct a
class project so that students have a hands-on experience in doing
anthropology.

**Requirements**

  1. Attend class.   The course readings consist of four ethnographic monographs; there is no textbook.  The overall framework of the course and many essential definitions are presented only in class.  You will have difficulty passing the course if you are habitually absent.
  2. Do the assigned readings _by the beginning_ of the week for which they are assigned so that classes can build on material from the readings.   _NB_ : There are 1200 pages of reading in this course and you are expected to read every page thoughtfully.
  3. Conduct a fieldwork project (40%).  We will work together as a class to construct an overall fieldwork project composed of your individual or small-group projects.  Details will be distributed in class.  Several due dates for stages of the project are indicated on the syllabus.
  4. Write two take-home essay exams (25% each).  They must be 2-3 pages, typed double spaced, with at least one-inch margins all around.  The essay question will be handed out at least a week ahead of time.  Essays are due: Thursday, October 15 and Wednesday, December 16.
  5. Attend two extra-classroom events or lectures suggested or approved by me during the semester and write a one-page typed summary of each (5% each).  Summaries must describe (a) the content of the event and (b) its relevance to our cultural anthropology course.  They must be handed in _within one week_ of the date of the event.

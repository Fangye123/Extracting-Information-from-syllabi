**Required Textbooks:**

Messerschmidt, James. 1993. **Masculinities and Crime**. Lanham, MD: Rowman  &

Vold, George and Thomas Bernard. 1986. **Theoretical Criminology**. NY: Oxford
University Press. [3rd Edition].

**Course Summary:**

The primary purpose of this course is to provide students with an introductory
understanding of criminological theory. Among the perspectives to be covered
are: religious and demonological explanations; the classical and neo-classical
school; the positive school; biological explanations; theories related to
intelligence; the various personality theories; socioeconomic explanations;
anomie theory; the ecological perspective; strain theories; social control
theory; and conflict criminology.

We will use the Messerschmidt text as a way of introducing feminist theory.
Since most crimes are committed by men, an adequate criminological theory must
account for this fact, as well as the lack of female criminality. The specific
nature of female crime will be discussed.

**Attendance, Testing, and Grading Policies:**

Attendance will be taken in this course. Students who miss more than five
classes will receive a failing grade. Leaving early or arriving late on a
regular basis will not be tolerated. There will be two examinations in this
course, **October 17** and **December 19**. Each exam will count for one third
of the student's grade. An additional 1/3 will come from a term paper
(described below). Questions will be multiple choice (40%), essay (30%), and
identification (30%). Exams will cover both the readings and all materials
discussed in the classroom session, including guest speakers and films. Exams
will not be cumulative. Students will be required to give the instructor a
blue book with their name on it prior to the test date. Permission to take an
all essay make-up exam must be secured from the instructor prior to the exam.
No exceptions to this policy will be allowed. Extra credit points will be
given.

Students are also required to turn in a short written assignment each class,
based on that reading assignments for that date. The assignment consists of
designing 4 multiple choice questions each class, 2 of which will cover the
main text while the other 2 are based on the additional readings. If there are
no additional readings, all four questions will from Vold. Questions must be
turned in on IBM-formatted 3 1/2" floppy disks in a standard word processed
format or via e-mail. Questions should have four or five possible answers with
the correct answer being provided to the instructor. Students will be awarded
one extra credit point for each question selected for the test bank. Those who
do not turn in the written assignments on time each week will have one point
deducted from their final point total. No late work will be accepted.

You may receive your grade early by providing the instructor with a stamped,
self-addressed envelope large enough to contain your blue book. Do not call me
to find out about grades!

**Term Paper Requirements:**

The term paper must focus on a particular theory or theorist. The paper must
include three subtopics: (1) a summary of the original theory, (2) the
theory's current usage/popularity within criminology, and (3) criticisms of
the theory.

Your paper must be double-spaced, with standard margins (approximately 1" all
around), and consist of a minimum **10 pages of text** , not including title
page, bibliography, or illustrations. One letter grade will be deducted for
each page short of the 10 page minimum. You must use at least 10 sources in
your paper. Papers must include pagination. You are encouraged to use the
bibliography in the rear of your book to locate relevant articles and books
for your paper. The selected additional bibliography can also provide you with
a good start for your paper. _Criminal Justice Abstracts_ is another good
source for locating recent journal articles. [The CD Rom on the Tampa campus
has _Social and Behavioral Sciences Index_.]

The system of citation and referencing detailed in the accompanying
[handout](http://www.stpt.usf.edu/~greek/class.html) must be followed. Any
other questions concerning style or format should be referred to _Publication
Manual of the American Psychological Association_ (3rd. edition, 1983). Any
major format deviations will result in the loss of a letter grade. Plagiarism
will not be tolerated.

The first paragraph of your paper is most important. The major theme or topic
of your paper should be stated in the very first sentence. Each following
sentence in the first paragraph should introduce the remaining subtopics of
the paper. In other words, the paper will begin with an outline or abstract of
its contents.

A draft of your paper will be due five weeks prior to the last day of class,
on **November 7**. At that time your paper will be evaluated by a fellow
classmate using the accompanying evaluation guide. One week later another
student will evaluate your paper. You will then have one week to reedit your
paper incorporating your classmates' suggestions. The final version of the
paper will be due one week prior to the last day of class, on **November
28th**. All late papers will be assigned a 1/2 letter grade penalty for each
day they are late.

All paper topics must be turned in for approval on **Sept 12th**. An outline
and bibliography (10 sources) will be due on **Oct. 10th**. Missed deadline
dates will result in a 1/2 letter grade penalty.

## Vold and Bernard

models? What evidence exists that the demonological tradition is alive and
well in the United States?  
c.) Compare and contrast demonological and naturalistic assumptions regarding
the nature of criminal behavior.  
d.) How do classical, positive and critical criminology differ? Which do you
think is a more valid approach?  
e.) Did you find Vold and Bernard's brief account of the differences between
"interactionist" and "conflict" criminology confusing or inadequate? What
additional information would you seek from the authors in order to better
understand the distinction they are trying to make?

* Chapter 2

as reformist rather than conservative?

modern criminal justice systems?

father of positive criminology is inaccurate?  
b) In what other ways did Lombroso attempt to account for criminal behavior
besides atavism? Why do you think he found less and less atavistic criminals
over time?  
c.) Discuss the following statement: Although quite aware of Lombroso's work
both Ferri and Garafolo disagreed with Lombroso on a number of points.  
d.) On what assumptions is contemporary positivism based? Why does the fact
that so many positivist theories have been proven inadequate not seem to
bother the text authors?

appearance and crime may be related?  
b.) Why would phrenology be considered a forerunner of Lombroso's atavistic

physique?

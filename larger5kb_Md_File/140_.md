HIS 2463 (0606X) Sum A 1998  
2306 Turlington 6th (3.30 - 4.45) HISTORY OF SCIENCE:  ORIGINS TO NEWTON

In this course we survey changes and developments in Western science (natural
philosophy) from earliest times through the Scientific Revolution of the
Seventeenth century. Lectures, discussions, and readings are concerned with
the origin(s), transmission, and development of scientific ideas, and the
emergence of new intellectual and language communities. Particular emphasis is
given to changing views and conceptions of 'science, nature, and man.' There
will be a **One Hour In-Class Essay Exam** in addition to a **Take-Home Last
Essay.** Please note that attendance and participation are mandatory. Students
may chose to write an extra-credit **Optional Essay**. Office hours for Dr

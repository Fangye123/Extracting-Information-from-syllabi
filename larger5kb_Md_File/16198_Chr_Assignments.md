**Explanation of Assignments

A. Reading:**  
Your professor assumes that students will spend time preparing for this course
outside of the classroom.  In fact students are expected to prepare for class
ahead of time by completing the required readings as set forth in the agenda.
Reading assignments should be completed BEFORE the student comes to class.

In this course the term "reading" is defined as the process of examining and
apprehending the meaning of the text.  This task necessarily calls for the
expenditure of time and effort on the part of the reader.  In other word,
reading is the study  of a printed document, and its purpose is the
understanding of its content.  This definition excludes the scanning of
reading assignments in a perfunctory manner for the sake of completing a
course requirement.

Remember we will use these three textbooks for the two semester sequence.  The
Cairns text will be our main textbook for the course.  The Van Voorst book is
a collection of  primary sources related to church history.  The Walton book
of charts will be an important resource for us so bring them to class each
day.  Read the material **BEFORE** we begin covering the material so that you
will be able to participate in classroom discussion.

 **B. Reading Reports:  
** Three times during the semester you will required to submit a reading
report.  Please use the cover sheets provided at the end of this syllabus.
These reports serve a record of your reading of assigned material and they
provide you the opportunity to respond in writing to the material in VanVoorst
text.  To complete the assignment do the following:

1\. First **detach the reading report** form for the appropriate reading
report.  

2\. **Record your reading** and **sign** the report.

3\. Answer the assigned questions from VanVoorst text.  This assignment should
be printed on white paper in 12 point type, ONE INCH MARGINS, and Double
spaced (MLA FORMAT).  Your assignment should be NO LESS THAN 2  PAGES and NO
MORE THAN THREE PAGES.  Be sure to write in complete sentences and use proper
grammar and style.

4\. Staple the reading report to front of your question responses.

5\. Remember your report is due AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS.

 **C. Book Review:** This is to be no less that 3 pages and no more than 4
pages in length.   12pts. Times New Roman font, 1" margins.  This is **NOT A
SUMMARY**.

**_Guidelines for Writing a Book Review_**

1\. At the top of the first page, put the name of the author, the title of the
work, the publisher's name, and the date of the publication.

2\. State the main theme or main points.

3\. Describe the evidence presented to support the theme.

4\. Assess the arguments and evidence used.  (Are they clear or unclear,
strong or weaj, convincing or unconvincing?)

5\. Describe the author's background and reason for writing the book.

6\. How does this work relate to other course materials?  Does it agree or
disagree?  Does it add a new perspective?

**D. Examinations** :

There will be three exams during the semester.  Questions for the exams will
be drawn from classroom discussions and your textbooks.

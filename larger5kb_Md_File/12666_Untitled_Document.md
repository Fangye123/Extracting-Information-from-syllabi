HCD 430 COMMUNITIES IN AMERICAN SOCIETY  
This course uses community studies as a window for the examination of the
major social changes in the United States during the 20th century,
particularly in the past fifty years. Classic community studies are matched
with pivotal research studies about the transformations that altered the ways
people in local places go about making, losing or maintaining community. Such
issues as the suburbs emerging as the dominant residential form, concentration
of poverty in inner cities, demographic shifts in household structure, the
restructuring of the economy, and the centralization of government are
explored through studies that describe ordinary lives in communities.

A total of 400 points can be earned in the course. There will be one midterm
exam (100 points), an oral book report on community study in your area of
interest, chosen from the attached list (60 points awarded by class) and a
written report on the book (100 points), and a final exam (140 points). Class
participation can tip the balance higher or lower on the final grade.

Those community studies in print or available as used copies should be in the
bookstores. A reader containing all the specialized research readings is
available for purchase at Notes -n- Quotes, Johnstowne Centre. All the
community studies and the reader are on reserve at the ACES Library.

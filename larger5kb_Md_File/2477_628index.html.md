**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course will investigate the history of immigration and ethnic identity in
the U.S., focusing on the period from 1890 to World War II. Drawing on a wide
range of cultural texts, this course will examine the immigrant experience
against the backdrop of US nationalism, Taylorism and Fordist mass production,
and the emergence of the cinema. How did these institutions and social
strategies attempt to Americanize the immigrant who was perceived as a racial
"other"? Furthermore, we will investigate the ways in which ethnic groups
assimilated into American society and the ways in which they sought to
preserve their ethnic identities.

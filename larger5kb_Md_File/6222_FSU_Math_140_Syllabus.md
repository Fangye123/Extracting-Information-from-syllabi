II. **COURSE DESCRIPTION**

> Mathematics140 is a coure on calculus applicable to business and the social
sciences. As such, it incorperates a review of college algebra with studies of
linear equations. functions and their limits, derivatives, applications of
derivatives, exponential and logarithmic functions, antiderivatives, definite
integrals with applications, and numerical techniques with applications. The
course is designed mainly for business and social science majors. A graphing
calculator is benificial but not required.

**Prerequisite:**

|  Math 123, Math 131, or equivalent.

III. **TEXTBOOK**

> Hoffman, Laurence D.and Bradley, Gerald L.(1996). _**Calculus for Business,
Economics, and the Social and Life Sciences**_ , 6 _th_ Edition, New York,
NY., McGraw Hill Company.

IV. **BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES**

######  

The course is designed to provide the necessary mathematical background for
students in Business, Economics, and the Social and Life Sciences to be able
to solve a variety of modeling and optimization problems.

Competencies in calculus will be demonstrated as students apply the techniques
of calculus to the solution of thes modeling and optimization problems in the
classroom and on homework

>  

V. **EVALUATION CRITERIA/GRADING SCALE**

> There will be four tests and a comprehensive final exam. The grading scale
for determining the course grade and the weights assigned to tests, final
examination, and homework are given below. The in class tests and final exam
will be graded on a 100 point scale. Homework will be collected randomly at a
rate averaging about once a week and given a grade of either pass or fail. The
homework score will depend on the percentage of passing grades assigned for
collected assignments. Late homeworks will not be accepted and the final exam
grade will be used as the grade for all tests that are missed. Make up tests
will not be given. The lowest score for an in class test will be dropped and
the class test average will be computed as in the example below. The
percentage of passing homework grades will be multiplied by four, rounded, and
the result added to the test average.

**Example:**

> To see how your grade will be calculated, suppose your test scores are 85,
81, 84, and 90, your final exam score is 88 and you received a passing grade
on 50% of the homework collected. Since the lowest test grade is dropped (see
item 1 under COURSE REQUIREMENTS), your grade would be calculated as follows:

>

> 0.20 * [ (81 + 85 + 84 + 90) ] + 0.20 * 88 = 85.6

>

> 85.6 + .50*4 = 85.6 + 2 = 87.6 = 88

>

> Since 88 is between 80 and 89 you would receive a grade of B.

**Weights Assigned to graded materials:**

In Class Tests | 20% Each  
---|---  
Comprehensive Final Examination | 20%  
Homework | 4% Extra Credit  
  
**Grading Scale:**

**A** |  90 - 100% | Tests 80%  
---|---|---  
**B** |  80 - 89% | Final Exam 20%  
**C** |  70 - 79% |  
**D** |  60 - 69% |  
**F** |  Below 60% |

VII. **COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

> Conduct of Course/Classroom Decorum

**1.** |  Students are responsible for availing themselves of _**all**_ class
meetings, Tutorial sessions, computer lab sessions, and individual help from
the instructor. There are computer software tutorials available for your use
in the Helen Chick Building, second floor and SBE 216A. (See the Lab
Assistants) Each student should have a textbook and graphing calculator during
each class meeting.  
---|---  
  |  
**2.** |  Students are responsible for maintaining a notebook of problems
selected by the instructor. Students are encouraged to include as many
additional problems as is possible  
  |  
**3.** |  All tests will be announced prior to their administration. Since the
lowest test will be dropped no make-up test will be given. There will be a
test given at the end of each chapter, except possibly for chapter 6, and
there will be a comprehensive final examination given.  
  |  
**4.** |  Students are expected to enter the classroom on time and remain
until the class ends. Late arrivals and early departures will be noted in the
record book. The class attendance policy set forth in the 1996-1998 FSU
Catalogue will be strictly adhered to.  
  |  
**5.** |  Students must refrain from smoking, eating, and drinking in the
classroom. The rights of others must be respected at all times.  
  |  
**6.** |  Students are encouraged to ask questions of the instructor in class
and to respond to those posed by the instructor. They should not discourage
others from asking or answering questions. Other students often have the same
questions on their minds, but are hesitant to ask.  
  |  
**7.** |  Students are expected to complete all class assignments and to spend
adequate time on their class work and to read each topic prior to class
discussion to insure that the course objectives are met. Two hours of home
study is expected for each hour of class.  
  |  
**8.** |  Talking in class between students is strictly unacceptable.
Discussions should be directed to the instructor.  
  |  
**9.** |  Extra recitation periods and/or computer lab attendance are
mandatory for students whose grades fall below **C**. They must meet the
instructor to arrange for extra activities.  
  |  
**10.** |  Dishonesty on graded assignments will not be tolerated. Students
must neither give nor receive help on any work to be graded. The University
policy on cheating will be applied to any violations. The **_minimum_**
penalty will be a grade of _ **zero**_ on the assignment.

IX. **TEACHING STRATEGIES**

motivating and imparting modeling skills. Students are encouraged to form
cooperative learning groups. I have, in the past, met with such groups.

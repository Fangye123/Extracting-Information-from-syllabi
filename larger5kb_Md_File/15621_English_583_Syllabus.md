#### Instructor Information

My name is Gwen Tarbox, and I am the Graduate Director in the Department of
English at Western Michigan University.  You can contact me by e-mail at
[gatarbox@yahoo.com](gatarbox@yahoo.com) or via telephone at 616-387-2584.  If
you are interested in learning more about Children's and Adolescent
Literature, Western Michigan University, or my work, please head over to my
Home page.  The Office Hours for this course will be both before and after
class and by appointment.  My office is in 218 Sprau Tower.  
  
Errin Bonner is the Teaching Assistant for this course.    Errin will be our
web pro this semester, and she will also be helping me to teach various parts
of the course.    As a former student in English 583, she is familiar with the
materials and the methods for the course.    You can reach Errin at [
errin_bonner@hotmail.com](errin_bonner@hotmail.com) .

#### Course Description

Contemporary American realism often finds its best expression in  Adolescent
Literature, a genre that has expanded in terms of quality, scope and theme
during the last ten years.  In the novels of authors such as Naomi Shihab Nye,
Walter Dean Myers, and Lois Ann Yamanaka, traditional Adolescent Literature
motifs of identity formation and sexual awakening are linked to issues of
race, nationality, and social justice, enabling young readers to acknowledge
the complexity of the coming of age experience in the United States and
abroad.  
  
This semester, students in English 583 will read a number of novels and will
create a web page that can be used by Adolescent Literature scholars and
readers on World Wide Web.  While no previous web page authoring experience is
required, students should be willing to accept the pedagogical value of
integrating technology and learning.

#### Learning Objectives

1.    Practice interpretive skills that will enrich your understanding of Multicultural Adolescent Literature,     especially those novels written in the tradition of the bildungsroman.  
2.    Develop an awareness of the theoretical and historical shifts in the composition, publication, distribution,     reception, and teaching of Multicultural Adolescent Literature  
3.    Build upon your research and writing skills through the completion of a course web site, confer discussions, a book review, a mid-term, and a final examination.

#### Course Syllabus

Monday, January 7, 2002  
  
On the first day of class, I will introduce you to the concept of [Process
Education](http://pcrest.com/pe.htm) , a pedagogical philosophy that
encourages students to take greater responsibility for their own learning.
Then, Errin Bonner, the Teaching Assistant in the course, will give us a tour
of the computer classroom.  We will discuss the [Teaching, Learning and
Technology ](http://www.pt3.org/) initiative at Western, the operation of the
wireless laptops, and the importance of computer lab etiquette.  Next, I will
go over our course web site and ask you to work in impromptu teams to help us
to discover the scope of Adolescent Literature resources on the web.  During
the last half hour of class, you will fill out a Student Information Sheet.
For homework, I will ask you to read a critical article written by [ Jack
Zipes](http://languagecenter.cla.umn.edu/gsd/faculty/JZ.html) on the
complexities involved in the publication of Children's and Adolescent
literature and to read this article on Adolescence from the [ Washington
Post](washingtonpost_com%20Adolescence%20Not%20Just%20for%20Kids.htm) .  I
will also ask you to obtain a WMU e-mail account -- this is very important, as
you will need this account and password in order to participate in the Confer
discussions (for more information, see the text description under Monday,
January 14, 2002).  
  
Monday, January 14, 2002  
  
At the beginning of class, Errin and I will teach you how to use [
Confer](http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/www/confer/) , an asynchronous chat program
that will allow you to share with your classmates and with me ideas about the
issues raised in this course.  You will need to accrue **10,000** characters
on Confer by April 15, 2002.   Then, we will take time to discuss the Zipes'
article and to explore the links on the web that pertain to Zipes and to
issues that he raises in his article.  Next, I will give brief -- old
fashioned -- lectures on The History of Adolescent Literature and on The Arab-
Israeli Conflict.  During the last hour of class, I will place students into
their Web Project Groups, and we will go over the project itself.  Team Role
Assignments and Team Role Definitions are online for your review in the
Lectures and Handouts Section of this webpage.  For homework, you should read
Nye's _Habibi_ and attend the [ Martin Luther King Jr
Convocation](http://www.wmich.edu/mlkday/) (to be held on Tuesday, January 22,
2002 at 7pm in the Miller Auditorium.  Admission is free.).  I am chair of the
MLK Committee, and I would really like to see all of you in attendance.  Also,
I will assign each of you a critical text to read in order to prepare for the
Book Review assignment.  
  
Monday, January 21, 2002  
  
Class will not be held so that we may honor the memory of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr and the accomplishments of all individuals who have worked to bring
justice and equity into the realms of American politics, culture, and society.
You can learn more about Dr. King's legacy by visiting the [ Martin Luther
King Jr Center](http://www.thekingcenter.com/) .  
  
Monday, January 28, 2002  
  
For the first hour, we will discuss Nye's _Habibi_.   Then, I will lecture
briefly on The Holocaust in preparation for your reading of Miriam Bat-Ami's
_Two Suns in the Sky_.   Next, we will discuss the Book Review assignment,
which will be due on Monday, February 4, 2002.  For the last hour of class,
groups may work on their web page project.  
  
Monday, February 4, 2002  
  
BOOK REVIEW ASSIGNMENT IS DUE!  For the first hour of class, we will discuss
Bat-Ami's _Two Suns in the_ _Sky_.   Then, groups will spend thirty minutes
searching the web for useful sites on African American history.  After you
have shared these sites with each other, I will lecture on the African
American literary experience(s).  The reason for the (s) is that it is
important to appreciate the diversity of experiences and traditions that are
part of any people's artistic and emotional lives.  Whenever we talk about any
ethnic or racial group, we need to be sure not  to assume that all people of a
similar ethnic or racial background have had the same experience.  This idea
is also behind what is now called "Whiteness" studies -- a topic interogates
what it means to be "white."  Homework:  Read Myers' _Monster_ and find one
web site to share with the class on any of the following topics:   African
American children's literature; African American male incarceration; Walter
Dean Myers.  
  
Monday, February 11, 2002  
  
For the first hour of class, we will share our web sites and discuss Myers'
_Monster_.   Then, I will ask the groups to use the Internet to find out
information on the Chinese Cultural Revolution in preparation for reading
Jiang's _Red Scarf Girl_.   Once we have shared our knowledge on the Cultural
Revolution, groups may use the remaining class time to work on their web page
project.  Homework:  Read _Red Scarf Girl_ .  
  
Monday, February 18, 2002  
  
For the first hour of class, we will discuss Jiang's _Red Scarf Girl_ .
Then, I will ask the groups to locate web sites on Native American children's
literature.  We will discuss these sites, and then I will lecture briefly on
the Native American experience(s).  Homework:  Read the collection of young
Native American writers' works in _Rising_ _Voices_.  
  
Monday, February 25, 2002  
  
For the first hour and a half of class, we will discuss _Rising Voices_ .
Then, I will lecture briefly on the Puerto Rican-American experience(s).  At
the end of class, I will distribute the Take Home Mid-Term Exam which will
must be e-mailed to me no later than noon on March 11, 2002.  Homework:
Complete the Take Home Exam and read Cofer's _An Island Like You_.

Nobody_.

Monday, April 1, 2002

If the computers have not already crashed and burned, they probably will today
- April Fools' Day.  But seriously, folks, we will discuss Yamanaka's _Name Me
Nobody_.     Then, groups will look up useful web pages on Gay and Lesbian
Children's and Adolescent Literature.    After sharing the sites, groups can
work on their web page project.   Homework:    Groups should be working their
projects.

Monday, April 8, 2002

Today, groups may spend the entire class time working on their projects.

_**Rationale:**_ The Enlightenment, characterized as a set of ideas and
debates centering around critique and reason, is distinguished today as a
defining feature of a recognizable Modern Western World. But the impact of the
Enlightenment on our society depends heavily on the emergence of a public
sphere in the 18th century, that allowed debates and the commodification of
cultural products. The seminar analyzes the ways in which the ideas of the
Enlightenment have been communicated. Examples will be taken from the printing
and reading revolution and the various forms of sociability. Students will
gain insight into the current research debate about the public sphere of the
Enlightenment and study two essential tools of the historian: source criticism
and historical interpretation of evidence. The course discusses texts, objects
and images as historical evidence and the methods that apply to their
criticism and interpretation.

_**Requirements:**_ READING JOURNAL: The reading journal should summarize the
main points of the assigned readings in keywords and reflect questions/issues
for potential class discussion.

CLASS PARTICIPATION: The nature of the course requires active participation in
the class discussion. To do this effectively, you must come to class prepared.
One of the main purposes of the reading journal is to help you get
organized/prepared for this discussion.

PRESENTATION: Choose a topic you are particularly interested in till the third
week of the course from the syllabus (topics are marked with *) and start
reading the assigned literature for this session. Then choose one primary
source which corresponds to your topic from the selection presented in the
Museum, the Archive or the Library. In the presentation give a preliminary
criticism of the source you have chosen and a first interpretation of that
source based on the assigned reading and your own research.

TERM PAPER: Detailed source criticism and interpretation will be the subject
of the term paper. Prepare a term paper on one aspect of the transmission of
enlightened ideas. Topics to choose from are marked with an * in the syllabus.
The paper should be approximately 10 pages long and must conform to
conventional academic style with respect to quotations, notes and references .

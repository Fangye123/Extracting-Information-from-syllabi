>

>> **MAP QUIZZES**

>>

>>> All map quizzes will be taken on the Harper campus in the Assessment
Center, Student and Administration Center, room A-148, phone 847-925-6541
[see: [Assessment Center
hours](http://www.harper.cc.il.us/prospective/test/schedule.html)]. Map
quizzes must be taken by the date listed on the class schedule.

>>>

>>> For each chapter students will be required to name and locate various
countries and physical and cultural features on a blank outline map of the
region. All of these map quiz locations are listed on the
[REGIONS](regions.htm) page for each chapter and in the [map learning
exercises](http://www.whfreeman.com/pulsipher2e/con_index.htm?01). A blank
outline map of each region can be found on the [REGIONS](regions.htm) page of
each chapter.

>>>

>>> There will be ten locations labeled on a map with the numbers 1 through
10. You will be required to name the labeled physical or political (country)
feature. As mentioned above, all of the required locations are listed on the
[REGIONS](regions.htm) page of each chapter. They will also be listed at the
bottom of each quiz. Do not label all of the locations l;listed on the map.
Only answer the 10 questions asked. For a sample map quiz see: sample map quiz

>>>

>>> Map quizzes can be taken individually OR at the time you take the unit
exam. I strongly recommend that you take the first few map quizzes
individually so that you can judge their difficulty and time commitment. There
will be 11 map quizzes (one for each chapter) and only 10 will be counted (for
100 points). Since I will throw out the lowest map quiz score and you can take
them at any time up to the time of the exam, make-ups on map quizzes will not
be allowed

>>

>> **EXAMS**

>>

>>> All exams will be taken on the Harper campus in the Assessment Center,
Student and Administration Center, room A-148, phone 847-925-6541 [see:
[Assessment Center
hours](http://www.harper.cc.il.us/prospective/test/schedule.html)]. Exams must
be taken by the date listed on the class schedule.

>>>

>>> Exams should be taken at the Harper Testing Center sometime **during the
week** it is scheduled and they must be completed by Saturday at noon. See:
[Assessment Center
hours](http://www.harper.cc.il.us/prospective/test/schedule.html)

>>>

>>> Students will be allowed to take an exam at a later time other the
scheduled week only IF:

>>>

>>>> 1\. the instructor is notified **BEFORE** the week the exam is scheduled
AND  
>  2\. the student has a very good reason.

>>

>> **ONLINE SAMPLE TESTS**

>>

>>> The online sample are ten multiple choice questions. Go to the [textbook
website](http://www.whfreeman.com/pulsipher2e/con_index.htm?01) and click on
"Sample Tests". You will see the following: ![](gifs/other/sampletest.gif)

>>>

>>> Enter your first and last name. For my email address enter:
**mhealy@harper.cc.il.us**

>>>

>>> Since you will be taking these sample tests at home I have no way to
assure that you are not using the textbook, THEREFORE I will give an AUTOMATIC
5 points for each quiz taken no matter how well you do on them. All you have
to do is take them. I do suggest that you study hard and then take them
without using the textbook or notes so that you can judge whether you have
studied enough. Remember, you get the 5 points per quiz no matter how well you
do. _You must take the sample tests BEFORE taking the on-campus unit exam._

**PISI 431**  
**Constitutional Law: Separation of Powers and Federalism Fall** **2002  
Instructor: Dr. H. Coleman McGinnis  
  
Course Description  
     **   
     This course is an analysis of the evolution of the American Constitutional system, focusing primarily on the issues which dominated the agenda of the Supreme Court prior to 1937--the powers of the three branches of the national government and the relationship between the national government and the states. Emphasis will be placed on the role of the Court in the political system as well as on the technical legal issues raised in the cases. **  
  
Specific Objectives  
** Upon completion of this course the student should be able to:  
    1\. understand the place of the Supreme Court in the national political system;  
    2\. discuss the meaning of "separation of powers";  
    3\. describe the Court's role in shaping the evolution of the federal system;  
    4\. show how early broad interpretation of the commerce power laid the groundwork for considerable expansion of the Congressional role;  
    5\. discuss how Congress has been allowed to use the taxing and spending powers to shape national policy;  
    6\. describe how the importance of "property rights" led to the Court's involvement in the most important issue of post Civil War politics--the proper role of the government (national and state) in regulating economic behavior in a society influenced by the theories of Locke, Darwin and Spenser--including the importance of the Court's "retreat" in 1937;  
    7\. show an understanding of legal reasoning and the methods of legal research by means of four case "briefs". **

Suggested Resources  
    **Since much of this material, especially that in the second and third parts of the course, needs to be approached from a chronological as well as a topical perspective, your understanding might be improved considerably by having access to a constitutional history such as Alfred Kelly, et al, _The American Constitution: Its Origins and Development_ (Norton, most recent edition 1991), Bernard Schwartz, _A History of the Supreme Court_ (1993), Leonard Levy, ed., _American Constitutional History_ (1989), or Melvin Uroksky, _A March of Liberty: A Constitutional History of the United States_ (Knopf, 1988). Sources on the framing of the Constitution include Max Farrand, _The Framing of the Constitution of the United States_ (1913), Leonard Levy, ed., _Essays on the Making of the Constitution_ (1987), Carl Van Doren, _The Great Rehearsal: The Story of the Making of the Constitution of the United States_ (1948), and Leonard Levy and Dennis J. Mahoney, eds., _The Framing and Ratification of the Constitution_ (1987).  An excellent description of the events leading up to the shift in the Court's direction in 1937 is William Leuchtenburg, _The Supreme Court Reborn: The Constitutional Revolution in the Age of Roosevelt_ (1995).  How the Supreme Court works is described in Forrest Maltzman, et al, _Crafting Law on the Supreme Court_ (2000), Howard Spaeth, _Supreme Court Policy Making: Explanation and Prediction_ (1979), Lee Epstein and Jack Knight, _The Choices Justices Make_ (1998), and Walter J. Murphy's classic _Elements of Judicial Strategy_ (1964). Especially useful on legal reasoning are Brain L. Porto, _The Craft of Legal Reasoning_ (1998) and Leif Carter and Thomas Burke, _Reason in Law_ (6th ed., 2002)    
     You should also become familiar with some helpful web sites. The [TPSA](http://www.mtsu.edu/~polsci/tpsa/law.htm) can link you to many useful resources. [Findlaw](http://www.findlaw.com) and [Lawyertool](http://www.lawyertool.com/) give you access to court opinions, both federal and state, as well as a variety of other legal resources. You can access Lexis-Nexis via the [TSU library](http://www.tnstate.edu/library/database_oncampus.htm) website. (If you are off campus, you will be asked for a username and password.) And the [Virtual Law Library](http://www.law.indiana.edu/v-lib/) at Indiana University School of Law contains, among other things, a list of all law journals on the Web with links to their sites. You might be in a better position to utilize this link if you have previously looked up your topic in the _Index to Legal Periodicals_ and hence know specifically what journals to search. For those less computer literate, the Vanderbilt Law Library will allow you access to its stacks without charge, but it will not allow you to check anything out.    
     If you have regular access to a computer, you are encouraged to communicate any questions you have while you are reading via [Email](mailto:coleym@mindspring.com). The questions will be answered either by return or in the next class meeting.

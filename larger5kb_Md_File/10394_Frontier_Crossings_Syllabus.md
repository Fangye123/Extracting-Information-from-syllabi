>  Frontiers are mythic spaces for the individual and the nation. In the
Americas, western culture crossed into frontier spaces, conquering and
mythologizing them as regenerative or barbaric spaces. This course considers
the myth of the frontier in the Americas through a diverse sampling of essays,
fiction and films. The course is structured around texts that highlight
theoretical questions central to the frontier experience in North and South
America. Topics include the representation of Native Americans, the frontier
as a barbaric space in Spanish America, Hollywood cowboys, Mexico as border
and frontier and feminist revisions of the frontier myth. Readings include
Domingo Sarmiento, Frederick Jackson Turner, Willa Cather, Cormac McCarthy,
Carlos Fuentes and Alejo Carpentier. We will watch Roy Rogers movies and John
Ford's The Searchers, starring John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter and Natalie Wood.  
>  
>  
>  **Requirements:**  
>  
>  There will be two 5-7 page papers, MLA format, incorporating secondary
sources. The first will be on film (either Roy Rogers or The Searchers). The
second will be on a novel covered in class (either Cather, McCarthy or
Fuentes). Students will have a month to complete these papers: two weeks to
generate a draft and two weeks to meet with a Writing Fellow to revise their
drafts. I expect both papers to be turned in with the original draft and
Writing Fellow comments attached.  
>  
>  There will be a brief take-home exam at the end of Reading Period.  
>  
>  Finally, participation will be given substantial weight in this class.
Participation is not limited to in-class participation. It will also include
smaller assignments, such as flagging passages for discussion prior to class,
or writing discussion questions or half page response papers.

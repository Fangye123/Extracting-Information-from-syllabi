  |  **Course Description:**  
The Celtic-speaking peoples of continental Europe and the British Isles have
left us a rich archaeological, historical and mythological record. During the
pre-Roman Iron Age the remains of their settlements and burial grounds can be
found from Spain to the Black Sea, one of the reasons that they have recently
become a focus of research funded by the European Community. This course will
trace the archaeological beginnings of the Celtic tradition from its late
Neolithic/early Bronze Age roots to the western-most outposts of the Celtic
world in the British Isles. From fabulous gold jewelery to mysterious bog
bodies, the archaeology of the ancient Celts has it all! We will explore this
legacy through the archaeological, historical and literary records, with
reference to sites, monuments and written texts from the Mediterranean world
and the British Isles. The course will also explore the historical and
political construction of the concept of  "the Celts", which has become the
metaphor for the emerging and contested European community. How are cultures,
and ethnicity, defined, appropriated, debated? Various nationalist movements,
including those in Wales and and Ireland, make use of the Celts as a vehicle
for their contemporary concerns. The course will consider the notion of
"Celticity" in the post-industrial era as well as its prehistoric roots.  
  
**Evaluation and Grading:**  

  1. Two short papers (5 pages minimum): 30% of the course grade. Choose two of the weekly topics, and provide an analysis of that topic. See attached guide to preparing short papers. Penalty for late papers: One full point per day. Each paper is worth 20% of your final grade, so one full point is 1% of the final grade. This adds up, so stay on schedule!!
  
  

  2. Final paper (15 pages minimum): 40% of the course grade. Choose one of the short paper topics and expand it, or you may choose a different course topic for the final paper. Be sure to include any references not assigned as class reading in your bibliography.
  
  

  3. Bi-weekly Summaries of Readings: 10% of the course grade. Students will choose two articles from the Course Reader every two weeks and will hand in 1 paragraph (single spaced) summaries for each reading. Summaries are due every other Tuesday. See attached guidelines for preparing summaries.
  
  

  4. Group Work: 20% of the course grade. Beginning with Week 4, every two weeks (even numbered weeks), a group of 3-4 students will present a topic covered by the reserve reading. The Group Topics will be assigned at the beginning of the semester, and all work will be due on the day of the presentation. See attached guidelines for Group Work.
  
  

  5. Extra Credit: Up to 3 points for attending public lectures on archaeological topics during the semester. See the following Web sites for lecture days and times:

**Short Paper Guidelines 1**  
  

  1. Papers must be typed (computer or typewriter).
  2. Papers must be 5-10 pages long. Paginate all pages beginning with Page 2!
  
  

  3. Papers must be double spaced. (I also need to be able to write comments in the margins, so make sure these are 1" all around, no more, no less.)
  
  

  4. You are expected to explore the assigned or chosen topic further in written form. This includes a) citations from the reading and b) original ideas/thoughts/opinions, backed up by cogent arguments.
  
  

  5. You must cite at least THREE sources in constructing your argument. Look at assigned readings for examples of how to cite sources within the body of your text. Both direct quotes and paraphrased excerpts must be cited, and listed in the References.
  
  

  6. If you choose a specific example or case study from the readings to discuss, you will still be expected to refer to relevant reading from other sources. This is meant to ensure that you get more than just a one-sided perspective on what can be complex concepts.
  
  

  7. When citing sources (direct quotation or paraphrasing), the following rules apply:  
  
The author's last name ( include the first initial only if there are two
authors being cited in the paper with the same last name) followed by the year
of publication, a colon and the page number(s). (This is the standard
procedure in anthropological publications). No footnotes or endnotes!
Quotation marks should be used where appropriate, as in the examples below.

  
  

> Example #1: "The moon is made of green cheese" (McDonald 1989:123).  
>  Example #2: According to Williams, the moon is made of fried green tomatoes
(1988:19-23).

  8. If you have experienced a burst of energy and ambition and have done some additional reading not assigned in the syllabus (unlikely but not impossible), then you should cite the authors as above.
  
  

  9. You must include a bibliography with full references at the end of the paper. For examples of how to format a bibliography, see assigned readings.
  
  
Good luck! Contact me at barnold@uwm.edu if you have any other questions.  

1 Please follow these standards for the final paper as well!  
  
---  
  
**Summaries of Readings**  
  

  1. You must produce brief, typewritten or computer-generated summaries of three articles or chapters from the list of additional readings as scheduled in the syllabus. Each summary should be at least one paragraph long (single-spaced); they may be longer.
  
  

  2. Critique the approach or problem outlined in the articles you have chosen by identifying both their limitations and their potential. Pay particular attention to the following questions in your summary:
    1. What is/are the main point(s) of the chapter or article?
    2. Are you convinced by the author'(s') reasoning? Why or why not
    3. How does the article compare to other readings on this subject?
    4. What part of the discussion did you find especially interesting or provocative?
  

  3. Think critically! This involves more than simply shooting holes in someone else's theory or approach. Demonstrate that you are able to see more than one side of an issue. Suggest alternatives.

  
---  
  
**Group Presentations**  
  

  1. Meet with members of your group **at least** two weeks before your group presentation. Assign each group member a specific aspect of the general topic to focus on for their portion of the presentation. Do some searching of library resources at UWM and elsewhere to come up with additional sources on the assigned topic. Set up a second meeting after gathering the material you will use. Remember to think of ways to present your part of the topic in visual form through handouts, overheads or PowerPoint images.
  
  

  2. Each presenter should prepare a set of **5 key points** outlining your topic. Imagine you are boiling the topic down to these 5 statements for a friend or roommate who knows nothing about the Celts. You may use visual aids such as handouts or overheads. Use these points as a guide in your presentation.
  
  

  3. The group should generate a document to hand out to members of the class on the day of the presentation that includes:
    1. Title of topic
    2. Name of presenters, titles of their subtopics, and their five key points
    3. Comprehensive bibliography of all the sources cited in the group presentation.
  

  4. Each presentation must be no more than **10 minutes long**. The presentations will be followed by class questions and discussion.
  
  

  5. Each presenter should produce a two page (minimum) document to be handed in at the end of class on the day of the group presentation. This should recreate in written form the narrative you will be presenting to the class orally, and must include a bibliography.

Group Presentation due dates are listed on the syllabus!

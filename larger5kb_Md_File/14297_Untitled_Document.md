**Content:**  
This course will explore in detail the mass immigration of Jews from Eastern
Europe to America during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In
the first half of the course we will explore the roots of the immigrants in
their Eastern European homelands, including the origins of Jewish life in the
region, forms of cultural and religious expression and the social and
political turmoil that led many to seek a better life on this side of the
Atlantic. The second half will focus on the ways immigrants reconstituted
their lives in the United States, investigating the challenges presented by
American work patterns and mass culture, the transformation in Jewish culture
and values, and the problems of antisemitism and immigration restriction

**Readings:**

(proposal, bibliography, outline, rough draft, etc.) will be due on specific
dates during the term and will be the focus of in-class workshops. Your final

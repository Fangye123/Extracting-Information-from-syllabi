This page has served 			9889 people and was last updated on Saturday, May 4, 2002. 			   The Ground Rules: Peer Review is a fundamental component of doing science.To help		make your discussion projects more scientifically sound, you are		being called upon to put forward your topics and ideas as well		as provide needed feedback to your fellow students. These are discussion topics related to Tropical Ecosystems of Costa Rica. Please feel free to browse... For students selecting a discussion topic for Tropical Ecosystems		of Costa Rica, Input Your Topic, and then review feedback here. Topics have to be approved by		Dr. Cummins via this web feedback. Specific topics are first-come,		first-served.    A Note from Your Fearless Leader   Hello Costa Rica Ecology Folks! I'm looking forward to our course. As part of our course expectations,						each student will present a twenty minute talk on a tropical ecosystem						topic of your choice during the course. These presentations will						be at lunch time or in the evenings. You may have as little as						one day's notice!  To do a good job in your 15-20 minute presentation, you will need						to hit the library and WWW well ahead of time. We will use the						World Wide Web as our Discussion Feedback Central. You can see						what other students are talking about and I would expect that						you would submit suggestions on other peoples topics as well!						In the selection of a topic, besides submitting a title, include						a synopsis of your discussion topic. What do you plan on teaching						the class? Why do you feel your topic is important? Include an						outline of your talk and at least 5 references! I will provide						feedback(everyone is welcome to contribute suggestions) via the						web.  The time line for completion is: -By Feb 28, 1999. Topic Selection, Paragraph, Outline, and Sources.						First-Come, First-Served! -March 30, 1999. Final Submission: Rewrite after having received						feedback.  Topics can include, but are not restricted to, anything related to tropical ecology.						Some topic ideas include land use, agriculture, climate change,						climate in the tropics, conservation, plants (epiphytes, emergent						trees, palms, understory plants); processes (predation in tropical						rain forests, competition, nutrient cycling, mutualism), hydroelectric						power, conservation, plate tectonics and volcanism in the Neotropics,						indigenous peoples, coral reefs in Costa Rica, mangrove ecosystems,						deforestation, species loss, or specfic species or family studies						on reptiles, amphibians, birds, or other specific organisms (e.g.,						monkeys, bats, sloths, lizards, parrots, fresh water fish, mollusks,						butterflies and moths) or other topics addressing biodiversity						and sustainability (the national park system, economy and sustainability						in Costa Rica, soil types, cattle ranching, the timber industry,						environmentalism, medicinal plants). Let your interests lead the						way. Do not be constrained by these suggestions! Look at what other students have talked about in previous years. To "prime" your discussion, you may wish to provide readings in						advance to the class.  Let me know if I can help in any way. And, if you haven't done						so yet, check out the Trop Ecosystems of Costa Rica Image Web Page. You'll get a taste of what's in store!

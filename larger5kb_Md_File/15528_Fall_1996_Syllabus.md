CHID 110 will demonstrate the usefulness of approaching ideas or intellectual
problems from a variety of viewpoints. It will also attempt to show that ideas
--and all cultural products--are formed in a historical context and thus are
contingent to that context. This is true not only of the ideas of the past
whether philosophy, literature, scientific theory or whatnot, but also of our
own interpretations of those ideas. This is to say that our own
interpretations are as contingent to our context as the original ideas we are
interpreting are to theirs. Therefore, you will be encouraged to consider the
"historicity" (the historical framing) of your own values, assumptions, and
cultural constructs as the first step in analyzing an intellectual problem.
You will also be encouraged to consider how the assumptions which undergird a
methodology affect how that method frames an intellectual question. The course
will provide a foundation for critical thinking, and demonstrate the value of
seeing from a variety of perspectives-- methodologically and culturally.

The class will initially consider the main factors which influence how someone
interprets her world and what values s/he uses to live in that world. By what
processes is one's world-view created? By considering the impact of family,
friends, community, culture and social structures such as education,
government, economy etc., we can see that each individual is caught up in a
web of varying influences--immensely complex-- that shape the way that person
sees the world. Therefore, by discussing the relationshiip between the
individual and her environment (in it's complexity) we should see that one's
world view (values, aesthetics, way of learning, et al.) are situated in her
historical context. A careful study of these factors necessarily involves a
variety of approaches including the panoply of academic disciiplines. After
starting with this personal and yet abstract point of departure the class will
focus specifically on one point of speculation which has had profound impact
on European and American culture: the question of what the human being is or
more precisely put, the notion of "Human Nature" as it evolved out of the
Enlightenment. Therefore the class is the study of the **idea** that there is
such a thing as "Human Nature" rather than an attempt to outline what that
might be.

To further illustrate that people form notions of human identity from their
cultural/historical context, and to provide poiints of commpaarison, we will
consider the way that some Native American cultures approach the question of
what a human being is. The goal here is to see other conceptions of he human
as being rooted in their own historical context and having as much validity
and potency as the European model. By considering positions often radically
different from those positions most commonly represented, I hope that we will
gain distance from our own presuppositions and thus be able to approach
intellectual problems and issues from creative vantage points.

In order to insure that there has been sufficient discussionn about the
lectures, readings and experiential learning projects, the ocurse will break
into 2 sections per week. On Tuesday the section will be led by a Teaching
Assistant, an don Thursday the discussion will be led by a Peer Facilitator.
The Peer Facilitators are advanced students from the Comparative History of
Ideas program. They will be facilitating discussion on Thursdays as well as
critically reading your response papers.

Course requirements: Two exams (40% of the grade), a final paper or project
40%, and weekly participation in the sections 20%. (Attendance at these
sections is required.) Weekly response papers (one page or more) will be part
of the participation grade and will be graded either (*) satisfactory or (-)
unsatisfactory. Any paper receiving a (-) mark will need to be rewritten.

**1) Group Projects** The process of working together, as students, to
**create** new ways of perceiving, or new approaches allows students to form
their own education, and thus be responsible for it. To this end, students may
choose to form groups of four to six people which will have as thier goal
outlining the best possible society. This society must be based on a
theoretical definition of "human nature" and have rough outlines for
education, government, and economy, among other issues. Once the group has
come to some consensus--each individual needs to write a defense and critique
of the plan. Given the difficulty and value of working in a group, I would
prefer that all of you took this option. If you do choose this option you will
need to submit a plan to your TA by the 4th week.

**2) Special Projects** If you have a unique point of view on this class and
want to do a special final project please talk to your TA. This paper should
compare your own world view or framework of who/what a human being is with a
radically different position. Each paper topic needs to be agreed upon by your
T.A. Although this is due at the end of the quarter, initial topics are due by
the 4th week.

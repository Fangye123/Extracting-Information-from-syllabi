******Fields of Psychology**

**Biopsychologists** : take a comparative and ontogenetic perspective in the
experimental analysis of basic psychological processes as they relate to the
many ways in which animal species adapt, survive, reproduce and evolve.

**Child Psychologists:** See Child Clinical Psychologists, Developmental
Psychologists, School Psychologists, and Social Worker.  

**Child Clinical Psychologists:** have about the same preparation as clinical
psychologists; in addition, they have the responsibility of becoming
acquainted with the developmental characteristics of preadolescent.  

**Clinical Psychologists:** are concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of
psychological disturbances. After graduate preparation in an accredited
university or school of professional psychology, supervised postdoctoral
experience, and licensure or certification by the state, some clinical
psychologists enter independent practice/consulting roles. Others find
themselves responsible for a complete range of psychological services in
public settings. Their responsibilities range from administering and scoring
psychological tests, to engaging in therapy, to supervising the training of
graduate students in the delivery of mental health services, to administering
a community mental health program. Some clinical psychologists obtain faculty
positions in a college or university where they perform research and train
graduate students. Others serve as adjunct (or part-time) faculty, while
maintaining independent clinical practices. Many serve as consultants. Ph.D.
or Psy.D. needed.  

**Cognitive Psychologists:** are concerned with what organisms know and how
they come to know it. They study how people perceive objects and events, how
they can store past events in memory, how they transform and manipulate
knowledge by thinking, and how they analyze their experience to emerge with
new and abstract notions.  

**Community Psychologists:** are concerned with the application of concepts,
tools and skills from the fields of counseling, guidance and rehabilitation
psychology. Community psychologists are trained to counsel, treat and/or refer
outpatients and to assist in the development of community resources for their
clients.  

**Counseling Psychologists:** are concerned with counseling, teaching,
consulting research, and/or administration. In their work, they are
particularly concerned with the role of education and work in an individual's
functioning, and with the interaction between individuals and the environments
in which they live. Typically, counseling psychologists work with normal or
moderately maladjusted persons, individually or in groups. This work includes
use of traditional counseling interview methods, interest, ability and
personality tests, and educational and occupational information. Most
counseling psychologists are employed in educational settings and most of
those in colleges or universities. A minority are employed in hospitals,
(e.g., the VA), community mental health or rehabilitation centers, industry,
government, or in private or community counseling agencies.  

**Developmental Psychologists:** are concerned with growth and development
from conception through death. All aspects of the animal or human organism
(physiological, biological, physical, cognitive, emotional, social, cultural)
may be studied.  

**Educational Psychologists:** are concerned with a range of activities from
initial design through development and evaluation of both materials and
procedures for education and training. Such positions exist in public schools,
in the military, in private research and development companies, and in
industrial concerns. They may deal with analyzing education and training
needs, with developing materials for instruction in various media, with
designing the best conditions for instruction, and with evaluating the
effectiveness of instructional programs.  

**Engineering Psychologists:** are concerned with designing and using
environments and systems with which human beings live and work. Their job is
to improve the interaction between people and their environments. They may
help design work areas, equipment, and human-machine systems, as well as the
training devices, aids, and requirements needed to prepare people to make such
systems function. They work in many different settings, such as the aerospace
industry, communications and transportation industries, the military, and
other governmental, commercial and industrial enterprises.  

**Experimental Psychologists:** a general title applied to a variety of
psychologists who are trained in designing and conducting research in specific
basic areas like learning, sensation and perception, human performance, and
motivation and emotion. A research oriented doctoral degree (Ph.D.) is usually
needed.  

**Health or Medical Psychologists:** are concerned with understanding how
psychological factors can affect physical health. Some representative issues:
how certain attitudes and behaviors may cause heart disease; how the state of
physical health affects one's psychological well-being; and how living with
cancer can affect one's attitude and behavior. They also study the psychology
of how people can better cope with physical disease  

**[Industrial / Organizational Psychologists:](http://)** are concerned with
the relation between individuals and work. They are employed in business and
industry, in government, and in colleges and universities, and may perform a
variety of jobs. An industrial/organizational psychologist working in industry
may study how work is organized; suggest changes to improve the satisfaction
of employees, the quality of the organization's services, and productivity;
consult with management on the development of effective training programs for
employees; design programs for the early identification of management
potential; administer career counseling and pre-retirement counseling
programs; develop affirmative action programs; recommend changes in job
definition; design a system of performance evaluation. A master's degree in
industrial/organizational psychology is a minimum requirement for a position
as a psychological associate but a position as a psychologist requires a Ph.D.
It is also probably the only field where you can earn a very lucrative income
with only a Masters degree.  On occasion, it is almost better to have just a
Masters in this field.

**Personnel Psychologists:** Compared to industrial/organizational
psychologists, personnel psychologists focus more specifically on the hiring,
assignment, and promotion of employees. Such a psychologist may be involved in
the continued development and validation of assessment tools for selection,
placement, classification and promotion of employees. Although positions as
test administrators and interviewers are available for those with B.A.'s and
M.A.'s, a Ph.D. is a general prerequisite for a position as a psychologist.  

**Psycholinguists** : are concerned with discovering the psychological
significance of the properties of language, of linguistic organization, the
meaning of words, syntax and how children acquire language.

**Psychometric (Quantitative) Psychologists:** are directly concerned with the
measurement of behavior (mostly through the use of tests) and the design of
research investigations. Such a psychologist may be analyzing complex sets of
data; designing, developing pilot testing, or validating versions of
intelligence, personality, or aptitude tests; or deriving new statistics with
which to analyze data. The psychometric psychologist is typically well-trained
in mathematics, statistics, and in the programming and use of computers.  

**Psychotherapists:** A very broad term. Generally, anyone can call him or
herself a  "Psychotherapist", but ONLY a person with a Ph.D. in Psychology and
a license can use the term "Psychologist". Psychotherapists can include anyone
without a Ph.D. who tries to help people deal with their problems. Counselors
and Social Workers are psychotherapists, but not Psychologists.

**School Psychologists:** are concerned with increasing the effectiveness of
schools in improving the intellectual, social and emotional development of
children. They may also serve as consultants in education for the handicapped,
mentally disturbed or mentally retarded; or in developing special programs in
adult education. They typically function in various roles within the school
system. They may assist in implementing and evaluating special education
programs, may serve as leaders of in-service training programs for teachers,
or as consultants to teachers regarding specific teaching or classroom related
problems. They may also help to treat children's psychological and educational
problems that influence problems in school. They may also administer tests and
interpret their results. An M.A. and certification by the State Board of
Education are generally required, and a Ph.D. may be required for supervisory
positions.  

**Social Psychologists:** study the ways in which the social context affects
the behavior of the individual and groups in the real world and the
laboratory. Social psychologists focus on topics such as social roles,
attitude formation and change, affiliation, interpersonal attraction and
interaction, conformity, and group processes.  

**Social Workers** : attempts to meet social needs by providing leadership in
the development of social policy and practice in the field of social welfare.
Social Workers help advance the professional practice of social work by
enhancing the social functioning of individuals, groups, families, and
communities. Two subfields exists in the field of Social Welfare, such as
specializations in either direct practice, or management concentrations.

![](_themes/tvtoons/atvbull1.gif)| **Advisement**  
---|---  
  
The academic advisor serves as the coordinator of your educational experience.
In that role, the advisor can help you clarify your goals, explore career
options, plan an educational program, and schedule classes needed to meet the
requirements of your program. Also, the advisor monitors and evaluates your
progress and attempts to match your needs with UTC's available resources. In
order for your advisor to be of assistance to you, you must clearly and
consistently convey your intentions and academic-related actions to your
advisor. You should also be familiar with course descriptions and titles as
well as the prerequisites for various classes. Your advisor is just that - an
advisor. You are responsible for making informed choices and for completing
registration forms. A few days before registration is NOT a good time for this
activity, as sudden demand by all students limits the amount of time that can
be given to any individuals. To maximize the effectiveness of your advisor,
plan ahead (which includes remembering to check -- and use -- the specific
office hours that are established by your professor each semester).  A good
idea would also be to read through the [FAQ](faq.htm) at this site before you
come for advisement.

![](_themes/tvtoons/atvbull1.gif)| **Differences in course numbers:**  
---|---  
  
Courses are numbered from 100 to the 400 level. Course number on the 100 level
are generally geared towards freshmen students and are intended to provide an
overview of the course material and to introduce the related vocabulary.
Course levels numbered 200 and 300 are more specific in content, while
400-level courses integrate the vocabulary and concepts and introduce the
applications of information learned at the earlier levels. As course numbers
ascend, professors assume that your knowledge and experience will allow you to
handle increasingly self-directed courses of study; therefore, more autonomous
study is usually required at the higher levels.  

![](_themes/tvtoons/atvbull1.gif)| **Dropping or adding a class:**  
---|---  
  
If you need to add a class and the class is full, you may petition to be
included in the class or to at least get on a waiting list, in case an opening
becomes available. There is a great deal of schedule changing at the beginning
of each semester, and chances are very good that an opening will arise,
particularly if you are in your junior or senior year. Remember, dropping a
class does not require the signature of your advisor, but you may be
overlooking a degree requirement which that class might satisfy. If you are a
junior or above, be sure to consult your advisor before changing your
schedule. (Caution: Class changes cost the University time and money, so plan
ahead as much as possible!)  

See your [STARS](http://www.utc.edu/classfind.html) (Student Terminal Assisted
Registration System) booklet each semester for information on the deadlines
for drop, add, or withdrawal).  Click here for link to [registration on-
line](http://www.utc.edu/online_reg/on_reg1.html).  You must have an
advisement code from your advisor to do this.

![](_themes/tvtoons/atvbull1.gif)| **Of interest to freshmen& transfer
students**  
---|---  
  
Whether you are just beginning your college experience or have transferred to
UTC, new students have much to learn their first year on campus. The following
information may be of interest to beginning students:

  
Psychology 100 Lab: Lower ACT scores and/or high school grades may place some
students at risk when trying to master Psychology 101. To provide extra help,
the Psychology Department requires these students to attend a Psychology 100
Lab. This Lab is available for all Psychology 101 students. Studies have shown
that students who take the Lab generally make better grades.

  
**Take Required Classes Early:** General Education (core) classes are designed
to:

provide you with the basic skills you will need to successfully master your
subsequent course work, broaden your sphere of interest, and give you a well-
rounded knowledge base.  Many advance classes require certain General
Education courses as prerequisites. Therefore, you should take these core
classes early on. For a B.S. in Psychology, for example, math is required
before you can take Statistics, Statistics is required before you can take
Research Methods - all of which is mandatory!  
Another complication is that some required classes are offered only once a
year and others are offered only once every other year. Failure to be able to
get into one of these classes could delay your graduation a whole year. A good
strategy is to take the required classes as soon as they are offered (working
your schedule around them) and save as many hours of electives as possible to
give you maximum flexibility in your senior year.

  
**Save Your Work:** You should begin to save your best papers to be used as a
dossier of your work when you begin to look for employment or apply for
graduate school. In addition, research from a project in one class may be a
valuable source of information for another class project. Begin now with an
well-organized file box and keep all your papers and projects. If you use a
computer, save (and label) your disks.  
Also, remember to keep your syllabus, at least throughout the semester. It is
good to retain them all through college, as they are a handy reference when
you are summarized your course content, either for employment or for graduate
school application.

  
**Save the Catalog You Begin Under** : Graduation requirements are sometimes
subject to change, and students do not always complete their education in the
traditional four-year, full-time schedule. You may choose to graduate either
under the catalog effective when you begin, or under the one effective at the
time of graduation. To avoid trying to hit a moving target, be sure to keep
your initial catalog.

  
**Read Everything** : When you begin your education at the UTC campus, you are
given brochures and catalogs, flyers and syllabi from various sources. The
amount of information may seem overwhelming, but it is usually information you
really need to know early in your academic career. Since it cannot all be
absorbed at once, divides the material into related groups and set aside some
time each week to thoroughly review these handouts. Any information you miss
could be something vital, like a unique opportunity or a "no forgiveness"
rule. Whatever else you do, READ everything.  

![](_themes/tvtoons/atvbull1.gif)| **Of interest to sophomores& juniors: **  
---|---  
  
Your sophomore year is the most "quiet" in terms of events and
responsibilities, but by the end of your sophomore year, you should have
firmly decided about your major (and/or co-major or minor) and whether you
will pursue a B.S. or a B.A. so you cant track your progress accordingly. Your
junior year is the time to take several important actions, such as applying
for the Honors Program and deciding whether to attend graduate school; and if
so, where to attend so you can begin application procedures.

  
Information on graduate programs offered at other colleges throughout the U.S.
and abroad is listed in Graduate Study in Psychology catalog. This catalog is
available both in the Psychology Department office and in the UTC Library.  

Top

![](_themes/tvtoons/atvbull1.gif)| **Of interest to seniors:**  
---|---  
  
You are considered a senior after you have completed 90 or more semester
hours. There is much to get accomplished during your last year as you prepare
to graduate.  
You must apply for graduation (get the forms at the [Records
Office](http://www.utc.edu/~advise/advise_records_htlm.htm)) no later than the
beginning of your final year. This is the student's responsibility - it does
not happen automatically. You need to order your cap and gown, class rings,
invitations, etc. by the date established by the UTC Bookstore staff.

You should already have decided about graduate school, have learned what
undergraduate courses are needed for the graduate program of choice, and have
included any prerequisites undergraduate course work into your schedule. You
should be preparing to take the [Graduate Record Exam](http://www.gre.org)
(see following section). You should be scheduling a time to take the ACT Comp
exams as well as any departmental-specific exams that may be required for
graduation.

If you are not going to graduate school, you should be in contact with the
[Placement & Student Employment
Office](http://www.utc.edu/~placment/opse_index.htm) as well as the office of
[Counseling & Career Planning Center](http://www.utc.edu/~utcsss/career.html)
(located in the U. C.) for their assistance in preparing your resume and for
job placement. You should be going over your catalog and your rap sheet (the
printout that lists what classes you have had and what you still need) with
your advisor to make sure that all the requirements for graduation is met. You
can use the graduation requirement list in this manual as a summarized check-
off sheet to ensure each requirement is met.  

![](_themes/tvtoons/atvbull1.gif)| **Preparing for employment:  
**  
---|---  
  
Although most professional careers in psychology require a graduate degree,
many career options are available to students who complete B.S. or B.A.
degrees in psychology. These include (among many others) careers in
administration and management, casework, health services, marketing and public
relations, personnel, probation and parole, research assisting, sales,
teaching, and technical writing.

  
A 1987 study cited by Goodstein indicated that in an interview of 68 major
organizations in the Chicago area, the following skills were ranked as most
important for potential employees: writing proposals and reports, applying
knowledge to identify and solve problems, conducting interviews, and doing
statistical analyses. The curriculum in the Psychology Department is designed
to help students develop these skills. Oral and written communication skills,
interpersonal skills, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking are the
areas of focus in studying the content and methodology of the field of
psychology.  

**Job Outlook** \- Employment of psychologist is expected to grow much faster
than the average for all occupations through the year 2005. Largely because of
the substantial investment in training required to enter this specialized
filed, psychologists have a strong attachment to their occupation - only a
relatively small proportion leave the profession each year. Nevertheless,
replacement needs are expected to account for most job openings, similar to
most occupations.

The [American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org) (APA) publishes
"Careers in Psychology" which provides additional information, including a
list of other publications on careers in psychology.

  
[Counseling & Career Planning Center](http://www.utc.edu/~utcsss/career.html)
\- Career counseling is available to students, alumni, faculty, and staff.
Professionally trained counselors provide assistance in personal, emotional,
and vocational assessment. The staff also helps students explore career and
curricular alternatives as well as maintains resources on careers, graduate
opportunities, and other growth and development issues. All services are
confidential and are offered without charge, except for some test-usage fees.
Two free tests administered at the Career Counseling center are the
Myers/Briggs and Strong-Campbell Vocational Interest Test. These tests are
ranked among the best in providing information regarding career choices.

  
[Placement & Student Employment
Office](http://www.utc.edu/~placment/opse_index.htm) \- UTC offers a Placement
and Student Employment service that provides assistance to degree candidates,

level seek full-time employment immediately after graduating (Scheivier &
Rogers, 1985). The National Science Foundation's 1986 survey states that seven
years after graduation, 90% of psychology majors are employed, with 94%
employed 2 years post-graduation. Also according to Cate 1973 study, 24 % of

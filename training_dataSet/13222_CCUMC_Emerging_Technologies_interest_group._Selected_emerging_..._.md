March/April 2001, Volume 36, Number 2.  
On guarding the quality of and dealing with interference on the 2.4 GHz band
used by both WiFi (IEEE 802.11b) and Bluetooth as well as wireless phones,
some wireless video cameras, and other devices.

**"It's a deafening sound: Bluetooth and wireless Ethernet rush into a noisy
head-on collision"**

  * Video-data projectors; Remote control systems

### Projector issues:

Smaller, brighter, cheaper, cost of lamps, standardization of lamps, DLP
versus other technologies, compatibility with HDTV such as 1080i and 720p.,
new connectors and control.

### New trends:

Port replicators and connections via Cat-5 cabling (RJ-45 connectors included
on projectors). Digital (DVI) connectors, mainly for computers with flat-panel
displays. Component video connectors (YPbPr) in addition to the usual RGB for
handling DTV. Monitoring and control through IP (Internet Protocol). Higher
resolutions (such as SXGA-native or better) at lower prices. Wireless
technology in projectors.

### Side issues;

The move of high-end electronic control systems (Crestron, AMX) toward web-
based systems and IP (Internet Protocol). Cable length and control limitations
for DVI. Returning to push-buttons; the advent of a number of lower-cost
remote control systems.

  * Hi-resolution document cameras

### Issues:

Digital output versus analog, better resolution but slower refresh, full-
motion at the higher digital resolution is a future trend, 3 chip versus 1
chip cameras, quality versus cost.

Here is a good introductory info source from Infocomm at AVavenue.com

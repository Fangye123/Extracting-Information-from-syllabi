discussion of a recently published book on Lyndon Johnson's decision to
escalate the Vietnam War:

>>> If you would like to follow this debate, in which historians argue the
strengths and weaknesses of this important new book,  click on **[HDiplo
Roundtable on Logevall](http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-

Scroll down the page and click on the introduction to the debate, by Rutgers
historian Lloyd Gardner, who has himself written a book on Johnson's decision,
entitled _Pay Any Price_.   Subsequent messages are posted by historians
Jervis, Kimball and Young, by Logevall himself, and by a variety of others.
Not only is this a good way to better familiarize yourself with the issues
raised in McMahon, Chapter 6, but it is a good chance to follow a vigorous
historical debate.  I will assign double credit for any one who uses this
resource to comment on Monday's assignment.

  * **Ten Teaching Ideas** \-- You will collect 10 teaching ideas for **teaching literature** in the classroom. Sources for these ideas might come from books,professional journals such as _ENGLISH JOURNAL_ , _LANGUAGE ARTS_ , [ALAN REVIEW](http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/alan-review.html), _THE READING TEACHER_ , etc., and/or electronic data bases. The Teaching Ideas will be evaluated using the following criteria:   
  

    * Student Centered 25%  

    * Quality of Writing 25%  

    * Usability 25%  

    * Variety of Sources 25%  
  
To get the full 25% in this area (Variety of Sources), you must use a
different source for each idea. Ideas taken from a single Web or Gopher Site
will be treated like multiple ideas from a single book or issue of a journal.
Be sure to cite the source of each idea _**and**_ include a bibliography that
follows the MLA format.  
  
**The Ten Teaching Ideas will be turned in to me[ via
e-mail.**](mailto:jcope@longwood.lwc.edu) This means you will have to set up
an e-mail account (if you don't already have one) at the help desk in Coyner
Hall.

  * **Alternative Book Reports** (ABR's)--   
  
You will do three in class alternative book reports. These three ABR's will
include at least one of each of the following:  

    * 1\. A nonfiction work that would appeal to adolescents (see book lists)   

    * 2\. If you have never read one, read a Stephen King or R. L. Stine novel. If you have read a King or Stine novel, choose an adolescent novel you have not read from the lists provided.  

    * 3\. If you have never read one, read a teen romance novel. If you have read teen romance, choose an adolescent novel you have not read from the lists provided.  
One of your reports must be (in any order) a dramatic response, one a written
response, and one a crafted/artistic response. (See attached examples.) Of the
four novels you will read independently, two must come from the list of
Multicultural Adolescent Literature. The remainder (with the exception of the
King, Stine, or teen romance novels) must come from one of the book lists
provided. Each ABR's will be evaluated on the following criteria:  

    * EFFORT
    * CREATIVITY 
    * HOW WELL YOU COVERED THE MATERIAL
    * PRESENTATION
    * OVERALL IMPRESSION  
  

  * The following are suggestions for the three alternative book reports:  
  
**WRITTEN RESPONSES TO LITERATURE**  
  
1\. Write the story in a book from a different point of view. Take an entire
story (or part of it and write a version as someone else would tell it. (For
example the third pig in  "The Three Little Pigs" might say, "I told my
brothers that straw and sticks just wouldn't do. Those are no protection from
a hungry wolf. Now me, I'm using bricks!")  
  
2\. Rewrite the story in a different time period. You may rewrite the story in
a futuristic or past setting if it is set in the present. Stories set in the
past may be written in the present or future. You may also choose to rewrite
only a particular event in the story.  
  
3\. Rewrite the ending of the book, altered from the original version.  
  
4\. Write an extension of the story, explaining future occurrences in
characters' lives.  
  
5\. Write a new story using your favorite character(s). The story may be a
sequel to the original or it may use an entire book or one scene.  
  
6\. Write a parody of a book This kind of a humorous imitation appeals to many
children. Parody the entire book or one scene.  
  
7\. Adapt the book into a script. Upon completion of the book, write a script
(dialogue, narration) that tells the same story as the book.  
  
8\. Put together a cast for the film version of a book. Imagine the
director/producer wants a casting director to make recommendations. Decide who
would be the actors and actresses. Include photos and descriptions of the
stars and tell why each is "perfect" for the part. Write a report to convince
the producer of the selections.  
  
9\. Write a promotional campaign for a movie about a book. This could include
newspaper ad layouts, radio and television commercials, and any special
events.  
  
10\. Write a letter to the author of a book. This shouldn't be a class
assignment, and any letter should be entirely individual. While authors may
not have time to respond to each letter they receive (they might not get their
next book done if they did), they do enjoy letters from their readers --
especially those that discuss the book on children's own terms. Send letters
in care of book publishers if you can't locate the author's address in WHO'S
WHO, CURRENT BIOGRAPHY, or other reference sources.  
  
11\. Write letters that may have been sent between characters at the time of
the story or at some specified time in the future.  
  
12\. Write a poem that the character would write. Knowing the character's
personality, write a poem that expresses the way he/she feels about what's
happening to him/her in the book.  
  
13\. Write newspaper/TV news stories about main events in the story. This
activity may center on human interest stories or climactic events in the
novel.  
  
14\. Rearrange a passage as "found" poem. Find a particularly effective
description or bit of action that is really poetry written as prose. Rewrite
it. Leave out works or skip a sentence or two, but arrange it to create a
poem.  
  
15\. Write up an interview with the book's author to be published in a
magazine (like THE PARIS REVIEW INTERVIEWS). Conduct research to find out all
your can about the author; then, base your interview questions and answers on
the information you found. Include questions about the author's back ground as
well as about his/her writing. Example: a) Tell a little about yourself. b)
Why did you write the story? c) is the book based on personal experience or on
a real person you have known?  
  
16\. Write up a magazine interview with a character or characters from the
book. Let the interviewer ask some background questions (name, age,
occupation) and inquire into specific incidents in the story. Examples: a)
Tell a little about yourself. b) How did you feel when your dog died? c) Why
did you run away instead of fighting back?  
  
17\. Write a character sketch of someone in a book. This might be the central
character or minor supporting character in the story. Tell what he looked like
but also include favorite color, horoscope sign, sports liked, and even a car
bumper-sticker or T-shirt.  
  
18\. Compare/contrast a character from the book with a character from another
book, the author, a contemporary figure (living), a historical figure, etc.
(Make comparison with one of those figures.)  
  
19\. Compare/contrast two characters form the book.  
  
20\. Write in the diary a main character might have written. Imagine you are
the person in your book. Write a diary for a few days or weeks as he or she
would have done.  
  
21\. Make a gift list for each of the major characters in the story. Explain
your reasons for giving particular gifts to particular characters. Gifts may
be abstract or tangible.  
  
22\. Write an explanation of why the story was or was not enjoyable. Be sure
to give adequate reasons and examples from the story.  
  
23\. Research a topic form the story and write a report. For example, report
on the farming methods used by Pa from LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.  
  
24\. Write a rational for one of the character's actions.  
  
25\. Write a test on the book.  
  
26\. Write the information for a book jacket (summary comments, quotations
from reviewers,etc.)  
  
27\. Write an obituary for the main character(s) in the book.  
  
28\. Review the books as if you were the book reviewer for a local newspaper.  
  
29\. Put the book on trail for potential censorship. Write why the book should
and should not be censored.  
  
30\. Write a script for a promotional video for the book.  
  
31\. Mimicking the author's style, rewrite a portion of the book or add on to
the book.  
  
**Return to Table of Contents**  
  
**DRAMATIC RESPONSES TO LITERATURE**  
  
1\. Convert a book to a radio drama. Give a live or taped version of the story
--or scene from it--as a radio play. Include an announcer and sound effects.  
  
2\. Make a talking display of a book. Tape a dialogue or description about an
event, scene, or character.  
  
3\. Do a dramatic reading (Reader's Theater) of a scene. Select the scene and
ask friends to help read it dramatically.  
  
4\. Read a scene with special effects. Choose a particularly interesting
passage and read it with a musical background or sound effects.  
  
5\. Convert a book into a puppet show. Make simple puppets (stick puppets,
finger puppets, paper bag puppets, and so on), and present the story or an
exciting scene from it. Also applicable to shadow puppetry.  
  
6\. Do a  "You Are There" news program reporting on a particular scene,
character, or event in a book.  
  
7\. News show format. Have the students construct a scene from the book which
would cause a news reporter to come to the town. The reporter will question
various characters about the events. In works where there is only one
character, students should imagine others who might have had contact with that
character. Reporter will comment or editorialize on the events.  
  
8\. Prepare an editorial comment, as might be given on radio or TV, on actions
of the characters and implications or that action for society. A variation of
this would be to have simulated "call-in" radio show with a newscaster
accepting editorial comments form the listening audience.  
  
9\. Write a stage and television series episode. Think of a popular television
series that a book or part of it would fit. Then convert it to that series and
give a segment before the class.  
  
10\. Do a takeoff on the old television program "This Is Your Life." Role play
a character. The announcer describes important people in the life of the
person honored. (This is especially suitable for biography or historical
fiction, but could be adapted for any book.)  
  
11\. Prepare a television commercial about a book. Imagine a book is the basis
for a mini-series on television. Prepare and give the television commercials
that would make people watch for it.  
  
12\. Use body masks and present a scene form your book. Make full-sized
cardboard figures with cutouts for the face and hands. Use these to dramatize
a scene.  
  
13\. Students will select a scene from the book and pantomime it. Costumes and
make-up could be used also. A variation is to have two characters with
conflicting ideas convey their relationship without words.  
  
14\. Assign student positions in a courtroom--conduct a trial of one of the
major characters concerning his/her guilt or innocence in the book. Use minor
characters as witnesses with teacher as judge.  
  
15\. Dramatize a scene form a book with other children taking parts. If
desired, use props and costumes. If children know the story, improvise the
scripts.  
  
16\. Role play a scene. A variation on this is to stop the reading at a
particular point, a prediction point. Several groups each improvise a scene
that they think may happen next in the story. After each group has presented
their scene, continue reading the text.  
  
17\. Role play two different characters, possibly form two different books.
Have one character invite the other over for coffee, party, golf game, etc.
Select two characters with different personalities. Make them talk to each
other about a common topic form their respective viewpoints. No violence.  
  
18\. Debate an issue. Have a panel of characters from a book debate an issue
from their differing viewpoints, or have two sets of characters form two
different books debate an issue or topic (can be political) as their
respective character would. All questions/viewpoints should be written out
ahead of time. A variation is to create a panel of characters form several
books and have them discuss an issue such as women's rights, monogamy, or
politics.  
  
19\. Play a version of charades in which the lines to be guessed are
quotations or key events in the book(s). Teams receive one point for
identifying the quotation or event, another point for identifying the
character who said the quoted line or who is most closely associated with the
event.  
  
20\. Dress and make up as a character in the book. Prepare and present an
original soliloquy that the character might give, or memorize and present a
soliloquy that the character actually gives in the book. A variation is to
assume the role of a minor character, describe and react to a major character
in the book; include responses (feelings, biases, etc.) that are appropriate
to the minor character.  
  
21\. Impersonate a character and tell an episode in a book. Dress up as a
character and retell the story.  
  
22\. Portray a book character. Ask another reader of the same book to role
play a different character. The two characters can meet, talk about themselves
and what has happened to them. This is especially appropriate if they have
something in common: similar adventures, similar jobs, and so on.  
  
23\. Taking the parts of characters, improvise scenes that are not in the
book. Choose situations that reveal character traits and responses that you
have discovered as you read.  
  
24\. Stage an interview of a character by playing that role while other
students pose questions that were previously prepared.  
  
25\. One student will assume role of telephone operator and through
questioning by the teacher and other students, discuss phone conversations
between characters in book. Variations--mailman, garbage man, milk man, etc.  
  
26\. Set up talk show with an interviewer a la David Letterman ad nauseam and
have him interview a major character of a book. Inquire into life style,
interests, etc. Interviewer should have detailed lists of questions written
out before-hand. Interviewer can interview several characters in the course of
the show.

**ART/CRAFT RESPONSES TO LITERATURE**  
  
1\. Make a new book jacket. It should include an attractive picture or cover
design, a summary of the book, information on the author and illustrator, and
information about other books by the author.  
  
2\. Draw or make posters or paintings about characters, settings, or some
other aspects of your book.  
  
3\. Draw a series of several cartoon characters presenting situations and
ideas from the book.  
  
4\. Complete scale drawings of rooms in a book. Use graph paper with a set
scale and design places portrayed in book.  
  
5\. Draw a scale model of an item in a story.  
  
6\. Make a scale model of a scene or the setting of a book. Pay close
attention to details given in the book in order to create a realistic model.  
  
7\. Draw a map which illustrates the setting, physical movement of a
character(s), or the emotional growth of a character(s). Label important
places or stages of character development. A variation is to build the map
using flour paste with food color.  
  
8\. Create a mobile which illustrates the tone, mood, setting, characters,
theme, or symbols in a book.  
  
9\. Plan and construct a bulletin board for a book you have read. Include a
scene from the book or the theme.  
  
10\. Make a collage to illustrate theme or mood. Use pictures, drawings, etc.  
  
11\. Make a mosaic using paper or broken glass placed on paper or set in
plaster. This can illustrate some element of a work of literature.  
  
12\. Make a class or individual mural using cloth as a mold, theme, or setting
interpretation. For a class mural, each student cuts his design (front and
back) from cloth and then stitches it together, leaving an opening for
stuffing. The item can be stuffed with cloth or newspaper. All pieces of the
larger design of the class mural are then appliqu eed to a large piece of
cloth.  
  
13\. Paint a wall or panes of the windows in the classroom with scenes from
the world of literature. Tempera paints can be washed off the windows, and
acrylic paint can be peeled off.  
  
14\. Design a wire sculpture that would be symbolic of the theme, tone, or
mood of the story.  
  
15\. Cut or carve a figure from a bar of soap or paraffin. Be sure to choose
something which is representative of the book.  
  
16\. Make a ceramic figure which illustrates a character of symbol from the
book.  
  
17\. Mold plaster relief designs. Pour plaster into a form over various
objects and then antique or shellac them to make interesting displays about
subjects in a book.  
  
18\. Design (and make) masks representative of a character from your book.  
  
19\. Make life-sized paper-stuffed animals, people, or objects found in a

theme form your book. Shoe boxes are ideal for this project.  
  
29\. Make a roll-movie of the scenes or events of a book. Put a series of
pictures in sequence of pictures with each one showing a bit more movement
than the preceding one. When this rolled quickly, it gives the appearance of
motion.  
  
30\. Make an animation of a scene on an adding machine tape. To get the
animation draw a sequence of pictures with each one showing a bit more
movement than the preceding one. When this is rolled quickly, it gives the
appearance of motion.

**Response Journals** \-- You will keep a response journal in which you will
respond to the fourteen assigned adolescent novels. Each entry will be due at
the beginning of class on the due date of the corresponding novel.  
  
**RESPONSE JOURNAL**  
  
After you have completed your reading of the novel, write your _**personal**_
responses to the work. State your feelings, thoughts, reactions, and questions
about situations, ideas, actions, characters, settings, symbols, plot, theme
and any other elements of the work which interest you or mean something to
you. Since it is important that you quickly write down ideas as they occur to
you, don't be overly concerned with spelling, punctuation, usage, etc. Just
think and write fast _**as you read**_. Your response should be a least one
page in length and should not exceed three pages in length. The following are
my grading criteria for your reading journal:  
  
**" C"  
** **(Summary)**  
  
If your reader's log consists of summaries of your reading, you will be given
a **" C"** for your log grade.  
  
**" B"  
** **(Author's Style)**  
  
In order to receive a **" B"** you will need to comment on some aspect of the
author's style for each entry. Such comments might include the author's
reasons for narrator choice, examples of particularly vivid or meaningful
passages and an explanation about why these appealed to you or their
importance to the story; figurative language, the use of "cliff hangers";
effective or ineffective use of dialogue; messages or themes, comparisons to
other books (such similar settings, characters, events, or conflicts). You
should not summarize if you wish to make higher than a "C."  
  
**" A"**  
**(Connections)**  
  
In order to receive an " **A** " you will do **" B"** (Author's Style) plus
begin to connect the plot to your experiences. You should write about the
effect the book is having on you. You should expand on the author's ideas and
attempt to discover your own. Listed on the next page are triggers for
responding in this manner. You should not summarize if you wish to make higher
than a "C."  
You cannot be wrong in your responses, so take risks and be honest. Let me
hear _**your**_ voice. The following is a list of _**suggested**_ sentence
lead ins:  
1\. I wonder what this means . . . .  
2\. I really don't understand this part because . . . .  
3\. I really like/dislike this idea because . . . .  
4\. This character reminds me of somebody I know because . . .  
5\. This character reminds me of myself because . . . .  
6\. This character is like (name of character) in (title of work) because . .

7\. I think this setting is important because . . . .  
8\. This scene reminds me of a similar scene in (title of work) because . . .

9\. This part is very realistic/unrealistic because . . . .  
10\. I like/dislike this writing because . . . .  
11\. This section makes me think about/because . . . .  
12\. This section is particularly effective because . . . .  
13\. I think the relationship between _......_ and _......_ is interesting
because . . .  
14\. I like/dislike (name of character) because . . . .

  * **Dialogue Journals** \-- You will write an e-mail dialogue response journal with a partner in which you will respond to an adolescent novel of your choice. You will send me the final copy of your dialogue journal [via e-mail](mailto:jcope@longwood.lwc.edu) on the due date.  
  

  * **Sample Dialogue Journal Pages  
**

  * In your response journal, divide your paper into four columns or rows with the following headings placed as follows:  
  
  

  
| **Notes on Text** | **Response** | **Partner's Comments** | **Your Reply**  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Notes on Text** | | | |  
  
  
  
**Response** | | | |  
  
  
  
**Partner's Comments** | | | |  
  
  
  
**Your Reply** | | | |  
  
  
  

As you read your book (which may be the same or different from your partners),
you will write information in each of the columns or rows. In the  "Notes on
Text" column/row, you will write any information from the text that you think
would be helpful to remember. In the "Response" section, you will write your
personal response to the work following the format we used for your Reading
Journal. After you have finished each chapter and written down your notes and
personal response, you will exchange journals with your partner. Each of you
will write comments on your partner's response in the "Comments" section of
each other's journals. You will then exchange journals again (you will each
have your own journal back) and write a reply to the comments your partner
wrote. You may follow this procedure after every chapter or wait until you've
read the entire work.

**Book Reviews** \-- You will write brief reviews of three adolescent novels
(see Alternative Book Reports and sample reviews). The reviews will be turned
in [via e-mail](mailto:jcope@longwood.lwc.edu)

**Book Reviews  
**

Using examples from the [**ALAN
REVIEW**](http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/alan-review.html), write a
concise review of the three independent novels you did not use for your ABR's
or Dialogue Journal. The reviews will be two paragraphs with the first
paragraph giving a _**brief**_ plot summary and the second paragraph giving a
_**brief**_ critique of the novel. (See examples.) At the end of your reviews,
please give a written statement that you did read each of the works entirely
and pledge the work. The reviews will be evaluated on the following criteria:  
  

**Plot 40%**...............(Covers the novel's basic plot in a concise manner)  

**Critique 40%**.......(Clearly states the reviewer's opinion of the novel and
the basis of this opinion in a concise manner)  

**Writing 20%**.......(Well written with a minimum of errors)

* **Attendance Policy:** Because of the nature of this class, attendance at all meetings is essential! If you miss more than 10% (3 or more classes) of classes for unexcused absences, your course grade will be dropped one letter grade. If you miss more than 25% of classes (7.5 classes) for unexcused or excused reasons, it is highly probable that you will receive an F in the course (see Class Attendance Policy, Longwood Catalog, 1995-96, p. 41). Be sure to notify me in writing when you must be away for an excused activity. In the event of illness or other valid reasons for an excused absence, please bring me a note from your doctor, an obituary, etc.

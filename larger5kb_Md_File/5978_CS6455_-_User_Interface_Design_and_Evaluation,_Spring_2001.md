>

> Knowledge communities, or groupings of individuals with common or
complementary interests pursuing common or complementary knowledge goals, have
always existed in our world. Historically, educational institutions have been
the most easily identifiable knowledge communities. Many of our colleges and
universities began as groups of people pursuing common understandings around
the creation, enhancement or sharing of certain bodies of knowledge.  But
knowledge communities exist outside of formal educational settings.  Company
boardrooms, chess clubs, soccer teams, quilting bees, cooking classes,
manufacturing lines and Weight watchers all represent locales where people are
growing skills and knowledge.  A family is a knowledge unit, so is a sorority
or a labor union.  A knowledge community may be formally linked and
identified, as in a discipline-specific organization with a governing
structure, clearly identified members and activities. Or it may be informal,
with loose or constantly changing structure, membership and activities.
Whenever people come together to pursue common knowledge goals, a knowledge
community is born.  
>

> In the age of the information revolution, knowledge communities are
undergoing rapid changes in their existence, in their constituencies and in
their methods.  Communications technologies have created the potential for
knowledge communities where none existed before. Individuals who were part of
a knowledge community for a limited amount of time, say the four years they
were on a college campus to earn their undergraduate degree, now find
themselves members of a life-long virtual knowledge community via the computer
in their home or office. And, freed from the requirements of being physically
present to participate, individuals suddenly have the opportunity to be
members of many different knowledge communities, constrained only by their
interests and available time.  The challenge for the HCI and software
communities is to design environments that support and enhance the activities
of knowledge building and information use.

>

> Traditional HCI task analysis and usability inspection methods are not
particularly helpful in this endeavor.  That is why a diverse set of
qualitative techniques have become increasingly more widespread in the HCI
community. Interest in these techniques derives from their inherent focus on
situated activity and cognition, that is, the playing out of real goals in
real world contexts.  Such methods do not come without foundational
assumptions about the nature of the world and of knowledge itself, assumptions
that are in counterpoint to the assumptions of computer science.  The goal of
this course is to make those assumptions explicit, to explore a variety of
qualitative methods and to use those methods to grapple with the technological
enhancement of knowledge communities.

>

> ### Course Objectives

>

>   1. Students will develop an understanding of the various
frameworks/paradigms that currently inform HCI work. Course readings will help
to clarify the underlying philosophical assumptions that the frameworks imply
including what counts as research, the questions asked, methods for data
collection, the kinds of data collected. This should help Ph.D. students who
are beginning to develop research plans.

>   2. Students will begin to develop skills in collecting qualitative data
for HCI development. Specific skills will include conducting ethnographic
observations and interviews, writing field notes and modeling observational
data for requirements development.

>   3. Students will understand the challenges of designing for both usability
and usefulness. The focus will be on mechanisms for developing requirements
for computer technologies to support such activity.

**Assessment Plan** :

Students will be provided with opportunities for self-assessment and faculty
assessment through a variety of research and reflective methods including
research assignments and examinations. The intention of the various activities
is to evaluate the students' mastery of the theoretical aspects of the history
of technology and material culture.

The following work will be graded and these marks will comprise the final
grade for the course:  **ITEM** | **VALUE IN PERCENTAGE** | **DUE DATE**  
---|---|---  
Mid Term Test in Ceramics, Glazes,  | 30% | Nov. 5/98

Sample Kit of Inorganic Material | 20% | Dec. 17/98  
Sample Kit Documentation | 20% | Dec. 17/98  
  
Students must earn a pass (50%) on each learning outcome in order to receive a
passing grade.

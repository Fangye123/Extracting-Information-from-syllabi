**Course Description and goals:**  
This is a **4** credit [New Century College ](http://www.ncc.gmu.edu/)course.
This course is the prerequisite course for **NCLC 350 Cyberculture** **and
Virtual Community**. The subject of study is various aspects of the Internet -
Web publishing, evaluating Web sources, investigating virtual communities,
becoming knowledgeable about copyright and the Internet, and other major
Internet issues. A significant amount of class discussion will be on the Web.
You will learn some basic html , use some Web publishing software, and learn
Web design principles.  This is **not** a graphics design class or advanced
Web publishing class. The major thrust of this course is academic - we will
study and critique the Internet culture, discuss basic hypertext theory, and
do a significant amount of reading, writing and critiquing.   A significant
amount of your work will be published on your [course Web
site](http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/nclc-studentWebpage.htm). You will have
the opportunity to revise some of your work if you follow [these
guidelines](http://classweb.gmu.edu/classweb/montecin/249f00/249revise-
response.htm).

This course has a **required** [experiential
learning](http://www.ncc.gmu.edu/experiential.htm) component,  for which you
and your group members will perform a technology outreach (ie., design or
redesign a Web site, teach Internet skills, perform Internet research)
community service for a non-profit organization. You will meet with the
organization members and submit a proposal. You are expected to contribute
**45** hours of time outside of class to fulfill the **one** ( **1** ) credit
experiential learning component.

The work load is commensurate with the number of hours. The sharing of
talent, knowledge, ideas, and questions is an important element of a community
of learners, so active participation is required in the class and with your
group members. You will be expected to assume the role of mentor to your class
members as you share your talents. You will assume the role of teachers when
you investigate and report on Internet topics and publish your findings in a
digital form.

* * *

**Course goals:  **

  * become knowlegeable about the social, political, legal, ethical, commercial and psychological aspects of the Internet 
  * become familiar with basic hypertext theory
  * learn how to research, analyze, and critique Web resources 
  * understand and observe copyright laws 
  * createWeb pages using HTML code, work with Web publishing programs, and work with ".gif" and ".jpg" graphics files). 
  * engage in and critique communication on a variety of computer-mediated communication mediums 
  * gain real world work experience through the experiential /service learning component of the course - using your technology skills to provide some technology service (create or redesign Web site, do Internet research, teach Internet skills, etc.) for a non-profit organization. 
  * further develop your collaborative work skills and teach each other 
  * compose well written compositions for a variety of audiences and purposes 
  * articulate how your learning experiences in this course relate to the New Century College [Competencies](http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/competency.html).

**Required Texts:   _Composing Cyberspace : identity, community, and knowledge
in the electronic age_** , Richard Holeton,Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1998; hardcopy
of _The_ _Longman Guide to the Web_ , Lester Faigley,  **** Addison-Wesley Pub
Co., 1999 _;_ **Service Learning Handbook** (Pick up in course materials copy
center).  Since this is an Internet Literacy class, appropriately, many of our
readings will be on the Internet, including [Cyberculture
Resources](http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/cyber-resources.htm)
(http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/cyber-resources.htm).

**Participation:**  
You will be assigned to groups and are expected to work with group members on
group projects and help each other as you are learning new technology skills.
If a student does not actively participate in the group projects, that
student's individual project grade may be downgraded accordingly. You will
evaluate each other's group performance at the end of the semester, [using
this form](http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/peereval.htm). Participation in in-
class and electronic class discussion is included in your participation grade.
You are expected to come to class having read the material for the class and
have ready any course work due for that class. **(Always bring your coursework
on a disk when you come to class.)** You are expected to   have your work
posted by the due dates. If you have your work posted on time, you may have an
opportunity to revise some of your projects, based on peer response and my
comments. If the finished products are not posted on time, you will not get
the opportunity to revise, and will just get a grade.  I feel no obligation to
accept or respond to work turned in late. Quality of work, not just completing
it, determines the grade you earn.

**Class discussion:** We will engage in in-class and online discussion. Come
prepared for discussions by keeping up with the readings and the assignments.
Much of our class discussion, synchronous and asynchronous will take place
online on [Townhall ](http://townhall.gmu.edu/cgi-
bin/WebX?13@118.XBdfk77j^3@.ee71cd9)( _http://townhall.gmu.edu_ )  See
[instructions for registering for and using
Townhall.](http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/how-to.htm#townhall) Small student
groups will lead class discussions, based on reading responses in Townhall.

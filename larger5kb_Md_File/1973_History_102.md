COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
  
A survey of American History from the post-Civil War era to the present. Major
emphasis will be given to the political, economic, social, and cultural forces
that contributed to the emergence and development of American civilization
during this time.  
  
  
COURSE OBJECTIVE:  
  
To provide students with a broad knowledge of American History during this
period; to provide background for those students who wish to obtain a deeper
knowledge; to encourage an appreciation of the diversity of American
civilization; and to develop the traits of analytical thinking and clear
expression of thought.  
  
  
ATTENDANCE POLICY:  
  
Contributions you may make during a class session are an important aspect of
the collective learning experience; therefore, I expect you to be in class,
and will notice if you are not. Please remember that you are responsible for
any materials presented during class, even if you are absent. More than three
unexcused absences may have an adverse, and possibly considerable, impact on
your grade in this course. Examinations and quizzes are not to be missed
without a verifiable medical excuse or advanced permission.  
  
  
AN IMPORTANT REMINDER:  
  
Students enrolled in this class must do their own work. Cheating, plagiarism,
and other forms of academic dishonesty will result at minimum in a failing
grade for the course. Plagiarism is defined as the act of passing off another
person's work or ideas from any source as one's own without attributing
credit.

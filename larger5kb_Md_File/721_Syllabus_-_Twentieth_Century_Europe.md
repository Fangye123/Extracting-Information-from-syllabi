**Objectives:** This course will survey the history of Europe during the
twentieth century with special emphasis on the crises of the First World War,
the Second World War, and the Cold War. We will also examine the loss of
European empires, progress towards European Union, and the threats of
resurgent nationalism and international terrorism. Finally, we will consider
possibilities for this century.

> > **By the end of this course, you should be able to:** Briefly describe the
three great conflicts of the twentieth century, giving causes, conduct, and
consequences.

The course also provides an introduction to the academic discipline of
history, historical literature, and the writing of history.

> > **By the end of this course, you should be able to:** 1) Describe what
history is and what historians do; 2) Consider texts critically: both what was
written in the past and what has been written about the past; 3) Construct a
persuasive argument based on evidence.

All of these skills are of great use after college.

**Class time:** Class time will usually be discussion, but from time to time I
will lecture briefly to provide background information. We will normally
discuss issues brought up by course readings, helping you to develop skills of
analysis, critical thinking, and clear speaking. In discussion, you and I work
together to meet course objectives:

> > **You should expect to:** Come to class, read assignments before class,
prepare for class using discussion question handouts (see  "Discussion
Questions" below), and contribute to group discussion (see "Participation"
below).

>>

>> **I promise to:** Come to class, read and think carefully about the work
you hand in, write helpful comments on papers, tests, and other assignments,
make discussions as interesting as possible, and answer questions both in and
outside class.

**Discussion Questions:** Questions to assist you in thinking about the
reading assignments will be handed out the class session before the reading is
due. They are also available on the website
([www.uiowa.edu/~c016017a/question.html](question.html)) if you miss class.
These will also be used to frame class discussion. You should write down your
answers on the sheet and bring them to class. Also write down other questions
and comments you may have about the reading--my questions are not necessarily
all we will talk about in class.

**Texts:** The books to be used for the term are:

> > Strunk and White, _The Elements of Style_ , 4th ed.  
>  John Lukacs, _A Student's Guide to the Study of History_  
>  Leslie Derfler and Patricia Kollander, _An Age of Conflict_ , 3rd ed.  
>  Erich Maria Remarque, _All Quiet on the Western Front_  
>  Elie Wiesel, _Night_  
>  V aclav Havel, "The Power of the Powerless" \- on reserve at the library

All books are available at Iowa Book and Supply, 8 South Clinton Street, Iowa
City. For books used later in the term, you may want to investigate internet
book services, including
[**half.com**](http://www.half.com/products/books/index.cfm) for used books
and
[**dealtime.com**](http://www.dealtime.com/dealtime2000/Pages/Media_MainPage/1,5375,36718-63715-1-books,00.html?Link_id=5-48183)
for new books. Copies of the texts will also be put on reserve at the library.

**Grading:** You will be graded on: 1) Your knowledge of history from class
activities and texts. 2) Your ability to think critically, to speak and write
clearly, and to construct an argument based on evidence.

I grade with pluses and minuses, and I do not grade on a curve.

**Participation:** Because discussion in class is a cooperative effort among
all of us, twenty percent of your grade is based on your participation. Half
of this grade is based on attendance, the other half on contributions to class
discussions. This includes occasional in-class assignments such as quizzes or
other writing assignments.  
  
**Attendance:** Absences are excused if you notify me **before class** that
you will not be in class. You can notify me by talking to me, calling me,
sending me email (I will check my email shortly before class starts), or
leaving me a note in the History Department office. This notice is a matter of
courtesy to me. Absences after class will be excused if I receive a note from
the Athletic Department for university sports-related events, or from a
physician or nurse for illnesses.

An excused absence means that you will receive points for attendance, **but
not for participation**.

**[Assignments:](assign.html) ** More information will be provided for each
assignment well before it is due.

> **Paper 1** will be a 3-5 page paper based on Remarque.  
>  **Exam 1** will be over the first five weeks of the course on World War I
and the Russian Revolution. There will be short answer and essay questions.  
>  **Paper 2** will be a 3-5 page paper based on Wiesel.  
>  **Exam 2** will be over the second five weeks of the course on the
twenties, thirties, and World War II. There will be short answer and essay
questions.  
>  **Paper 3** will be a 3-5 page paper based on Havel.  
>  **Exam 3** will be over the last five weeks of the course on the cold war
and the late twentieth century.

Late assignments will be penalized one letter grade for each day they are
late.

**[History Writing Center](http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Ehistwrit/):** The History
Department has a writing center to assist you in writing papers for History
courses. It is staffed with History graduate students who will help you think
about writing or critique a draft of a paper. Hours of service are posted on
the office door, Schaeffer Hall 303, or you may call to make an appointment at
335-2584. Their website is
[http://www.uiowa.edu/~histwrit](http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Ehistwrit/)

**Plagiarism / Cheating:** Any student who plagiarizes or cheats on any
assignment faces penalties which may include an F on the assignment or an F in
the course. If I suspect plagiarism or cheating, I am required to inform you
in writing and to give you a copy of the report on the incident that I submit
to the History Department and to the College of Liberal Arts.

**Students with Disabilities:** I would like to hear from anyone who has a
disability which may require some modification of seating, testing, or other
class requirements so that appropriate arrangements may be made. Please talk
with me after class or during my office hours.

**Questions / Problems:** Please visit me during my office hours (or other
times by appointment) to discuss your work or anything concerning the course.
If you feel that we have not resolved the issue, you should talk to Professor
Henry Horwitz, the Issues Coordinator. His office is 119 Schaeffer Hall and
his telephone number is 335-2288. You may also contact the Chair of the
History Department, Professor Ken Cmiel. His office is 280 Schaeffer Hall, and
his telephone number is 335-2299.

**Schedule:** Each assignment should be read **before** the date listed. You
should bring the discussion questions for the day with you to class and come
prepared to discuss.

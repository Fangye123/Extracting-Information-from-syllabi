Description and Objectives
This course is a survey of American society
from the Colonial Era to the Civil War with an emphasis on the role of
social life, politics, and economic change.  Students will be encouraged
to understand and analyze specific controversies and events in the interpretation
of American history.
Exams and Assignments
There will be a midterm and a final. 
Each of these exams will include a mixture of essay and non-essay questions
and will test knowledge and understanding of the text, lecture, and other
readings.  Makeups must be arranged in advance of the exam
date and will be 100 percent essay.  Incompletes are not allowed for
the final course grade.
Attendance
Attendance will be rewarded.  Students
who are borderline on the final course grade and have missed no more than
three classes (lectures and sections) will receive a one percent "bump"
to a higher letter grade.  Those who miss more than three classes
will be graded purely on the basis of points.  There are no excused
absences.
Academic Misconduct Policy
All acts of dishonesty in any work constitute
acts of academic misconduct.  The Academic Misconduct Disciplinary
Policy will be followed in the event of academic misconduct.
Summaries and Discussions
To facilitate discussion in section, all
students are required to write ten weekly summaries.  Each summary
will discuss all of the readings for one week.
The only readings which do not have to
be summarized are the chapters from America by George Tindall and
David Shi.  Please note, however, that students will be rewuired to
summarize the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation,
and the Constitution of the United States which are reproduced in the appendix
of America.
Every summary will be due at the beginning
of lecture each Monday (unless otherwise announced on the syllabus or by
the instructor) and can only cover the readings for that week.  It
will be corrected and returned in the section for that week.
The summary must be typed (no smaller than
9 point size type).  The text (unless otherwise announced on the syllabus)
can not be any longer than 36 lines.  Margins should be about one
inch on each side.  In addition, each summary should include a question
at the end to facilitate the discussion.  The question should deal
with some aspect of one or more of the readings.
Each weekly summary will be worth a maximum
of 10 points.  Points will be deducted if a reading or question for
that week is not included.  Only the first ten weekly summaries will
be counted.  Three grades are possible for a weekly summary: 
good (10 points), fair (7 points), and poor (4 points).
A summary cannot be turned in late or made
up.  It is possible, however, to raise the grade by writing a revised
version.  The revised version (which must be stapled to a copy
of the original) will be due in lecture on Monday of the next week. 
A grade of a summary cannot be raised more than three points by writing
a revision.

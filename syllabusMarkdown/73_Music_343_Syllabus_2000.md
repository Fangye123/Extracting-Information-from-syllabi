Nine written worksheets require listening, reading, research, and other
creative tasks. They are graded on promptness and completeness. If all
worksheets are complete and handed in on time, you receive an A+ for 27% of
your final grade. Late worksheets receive a D (67%) and receive no written
feedback. Complete worksheets include thorough answers to questions, and they
follow the listening report format described below. Incomplete worksheets
receive credit for the percentage I judge completed.

**What is a Listening Report?**  
A part of each worksheet, they help you practice listening skills and prepare
for listening quizzes while you explore the music we study. These reports
should be written **while you listen**. For an example of proper format,
[click here to see a sample of **Listening Report No. 1**](ListenSample.htm)
**.**

**Listening Report Format?**  
For each piece you listen to:

> a. identify the title and location (library and call number) of the
recording  
> b. identify composer and title (for the entire piece and for each individual
section)  
> c. describe style featureswrite 2-3 sentences on each movement or number  
> d. answer any questions in the worksheet  
> e. indicate number of times (1X, 2X, etc.) you listen to any piece required
for quiz preparation

**How much listening?**  
The amount varies; plan on 2 to 3.5 hours of music per report. Basic
guidelinelisten to one complete LP or CD (or the equivalent) for each hour
assigned.

**Where to listen?**  
You can use the listening facilities in Irion 202, at the Media Center (CSTC
109), or you can use your own listening equipment.

**What to listen to?**  
For most reports, specific pieces are required, but after that you can choose
any recordings (or live performances!) that fit the current worksheet. Start
with music from DWMA so you can follow the score while you listen. A primary
goal is to experience as much music as possible. Therefore, you can only count
**one** playing of each piece in your total listening time. (Exception: You
can count multiple listening for any piece that is scheduled for a listening
recognition quiz.) Recordings can be found in Irion 202 or the Media Center
(CSTC 109). (DWMA recordings are on Reserve in both locations.) You can also
use appropriate recordings of your own.

####  **Quizzes**

Six quizzes cover the reading and listening assignments from the current
worksheet. The written portion covers lecture materials and assigned readings
in multiple choice format; the listening portion tests your ability to
identify important works and hear stylistic features. Listening reports and
in-class listening exercises will help you prepare for these quizzes. No make-
up quizzes will be given for lateness or unexcused absence.  


####  **Paper**

A paper that deals with a piece of music (of your choosing) from two
perspectives: one analytical, the other creative and contextual. [Click here
for more information about the paper](00343Paper.htm).  


####  **Unit Exams and Final Exam**

Three exams ask you to trace broad outlines and vital developments in an
important period in music history. They include [essay](essays343.htm) and
short answer questions, with score excerpts and listening examples for
stylistic analysis. Make-up exams will not be given.

##  **Course Policies**

####  **Class Participation**

Attendance and participation are important. Under normal circumstances, tell
me ahead of time if you must miss class. In emergencies, present a note from
your doctor, the college health service, or the Dean when you return. You can
be absent or late up to three times each without penalty; further lateness or
absences will count against your final grade.  


####  **Extra Credit**

For extra credit, do extra listening and write listening reports on it
(identify these reports as extra credit and indicate total listening time).
Consistent attendance and participation will also help a borderline grade.  


####  **Academic Dishonesty**

This course follows guidelines published in the E-Book.  


####  **Disabilities Policy**

Elmhurst College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented disabilities. If you have a disability that may have some impact on

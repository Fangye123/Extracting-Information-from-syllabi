Course Description and Objectives:**  
This course serves as an introduction to American writing. We will read a
variety of literary forms, some of them considered to be uniquely
American:exploration and encounter narratives, as well as autobiographies,
short stories, and novels. I stress that this is not a course in literature
appreciation; rather, it is an introduction to the discipline of literary
study. We use the techniques of close reading and structural analysis to read
these texts as sources of ideas and for understanding literature as cultural
practice-that is, a  "doing" of the culture, and not merely an artifact of
isolated production. My approach reflects the same understanding in that the
course itself will be a sort of work-in-progress, a dynamic study and
exploration not only of the works on the syllabus, but also of our own reading
them. In addition to its primary objective, the course will encourage you to
cultivate proficiency in critically alert reading, and analytical thinking and
writing. Therefore, the class is based on discussion rather than on lecture.
You are expected to complete each reading assignment on time and to
participate in the discussion. The reading and writing schedule is rigorous.
Count on spending three hours of work outside class for every hour spent in
class. Reading for this class means giving your whole attention to the
structure, the style, and the content: an active and thoughtful engagement
with the text that enables you to make informed interpretations. In order to
participate, you are expected to bring the appropriate text to each class.  
I have designed the syllabus to accomplish these various, perhaps conflicting,
certainly complex, goals. Our focus is on the nineteenth century. Further,
these works comprise to a greater or lesser extent a literature of conquest:
each selection represents a personal or cultural vision imposed on the land.
--What vision, whose vision, will determine the shape of the land, the
formation of the peoples and cultures that live on it, the form of the
literature we call American? **

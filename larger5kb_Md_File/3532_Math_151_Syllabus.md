The Language of Mathematics

**Textbook**      _The Language of Mathematics_ , 16th ed., by Warren Esty.
There is also a solutions manual available at the bookstore.  
**Course Description**      This is a unique course. The emphasis is not so
much on approaching math problems and learning ways to solve them, but more on
approaching math itself as a language to be learned by reading, writing,
hearing, and thinking mathematical sentences. Phrasebooks only get you so far
in a foreign country. To really communicate with the locals requires learning
the language. I hope this class will not only be useful in fulfilling the math
core or departmental requirements, but also will possibly enable you to detect
flaws in politicians' logic and defeat an offensive generalization by a
counterexample. In this course, you will have opportunities to demonstrate
your math language skills by doing the homework, participating in class, and
taking quizzes, exams, and the final exam.  
**Prerequisite**      The prerequisite will be checked. There are three ways
to meet the prerequisite:      1\. Passing MATH 103,      2\. Taking the Math
Placement Exam and placing into Level 3 or higher, or      3\. Having a score
of at least 23 on the math section of the ACT or 530 on the math SAT.
Please speak to me if you would like an exception made.  
**Class Participation**      The first thing you can do to participate is come
to class. If you've read the section to be covered in lecture, that's a bonus.
Also, I will provide opportunities for each of you to answer and ask
questions. When I ask questions and invite you to participate, my intention
will never be to embarrass you, but to help you learn and develop your skills.
With this in mind, please be respectful and supportive of your classmates as
they develop their skills alongside you. Class will be more enjoyable for all
of us if it becomes a conversation in the language of Mathematics. I think
that although reading and writing are important ways of communicating,
speaking and listening are also vital to developing a fluency in the language.
Please ask questions in class if you are confused or curious.  
**Homework**      Writing is an important part of this course. Ideally, I
would have you work on the homework every day, since a 3 credit class usually
requires 6 hours per week outside of class. But I understand that this class
is not the only thing in your life, so I'll probably have homework be due once
or twice a week. I will grade selected problems and assign credit based on
effort, accuracy, and thoroughness. Please turn in the assignments on time.
I'll understand if you get in a time crunch and need a little more time to
complete the assignment. However, I don't want you to get behind, and I don't
want to be grading really old homework, so be aware that late homework may get
only partial credit. I encourage you to work together on the homework, because
it will help you develop your communication skills. However, write up and hand
in your own assignment, even when you found the solutions together.  
**Exams and Quizzes**      There will be an exam after each of the first four
chapters and a comprehensive final. Please speak to me (in advance, if
possible) about a make up exam if you have a valid reason for missing an exam.
Quizzes will be announced in advance in class and on the web page. They'll be
short and may replace one or part of one homework assignment.  
**Grading**      I understand that it takes time to acquire language skills,
so I will expect more of you at the end of the semester than at the beginning.
Your final grade will be based on homework, quizzes, class participation,
exams, and the final. I'm not being specific about the exact weight placed on
each thing because it varies from person to person when during the semester
they become fluent and which mode of expression, writing or speaking, that
this fluency becomes evident to me. So your final grade will be determined
mostly by the exams, homework assignments, and your class participation closer
to the end of the term. The quizzes, exams, homework, and participation at the
beginning of the semester will be very important learning and diagnostic
tools. I will grade the exams and interpret your score so that you have an
idea what letter grade you can expect if you continue to perform at the same
level.  
**Et cetera**      Take advantage of office hours! No question is too small,
and no concern is too trivial to visit with me about it. I'm here to help you
learn. If you have a question and can't make it to an office hour, please feel
free to email me your question or schedule a time to meet me.  
Cheating will not be tolerated and will result in a zero on the exam or quiz.
Working together on homework and writing up your own assignment is not
cheating.  
  
This course has the been the subject of many math education research articles.
I'll be collecting information from the survey and maybe some quizzes because
I'm interested in how this class facilitates your understanding of math
concepts. We will keep everything voluntary and anonymous for your privacy if
we publish a research paper about this class.  
If you experience a sudden illumination of math concepts (like Andrew Wiles'
quote on the Math 151 home page) and would like to share your experience with
me, please come to an office hour or call or email me. This may happen close
to the end of the course, and I would love to hear about it. I've experienced
such illuminations (I also call it an Aha! moment) after ten or twelve weeks
of a challenging course, and they're very exciting!

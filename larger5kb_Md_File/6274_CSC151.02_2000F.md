# How to Use the Course Web

For a number of reasons, I have chosen to make many of the handouts for this
course available only in electronic format on the World-Wide Web. I will not
go over basic use of the Web, since you should know about it from other
courses. You should make sure to ask me if you have any questions about using
the World-Wide Web.

The course web can be found at
[`http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS151/2000F/`](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS151/2000F/)
You may want to bookmark that page.

A number of important pieces of information are in the course web, including
assignments, readings, requirements, syllabus, and office hours. I assume that
if I put information on the Web, you will (eventually) read it.

  * At the bare minimum, you should read all the pieces of [basic information](../index.html) about the course. Of particular interest is the [course at a glance](glance.html) page, which lists all the readings. I will also hand out a copy of this information on the first day of class. 
  * I prepare a rough [outline](../Outlines/index.html) for each class. Most students find these useful, and you should feel free to refer to them before, during, and after class. 
  * Each outline begins with some notes. You can find just the notes in a separate [news](../Handouts/news.html) page. 

At the top and bottom of every page are a series of links to important
components of the course web. These are

  * [Current](../Outlines/current.html). The outline of the current or next class. You may need to reload the page to get the appropriate version. 
  * [News](news.html). The course news, taken from the outlines. 
  * [Glance](glance.html). An abbreviated version of the syllabus. 
  * [Search](../search.cgi). A simple search facility for the course web. 
  * [Instructions](instructions.html). This set of instructions. 
  * [Links](links.html). A collection of links that you might find useful. 
  * [Handouts](index.html). Handouts for the class. 
  * [Project](index.html). Information on the course project, including code files once they become available. 
  * [Outlines](../Outlines/index.html). The outlines of classes that have been held. You can sometimes access other outlines through the [syllabus](syllabus.html). 
  * [Daily Readings](../Readings/index.html). These will often take the place of the textbook. I do expect you to read them before the corresponding labs. 
  * [Labs](../Labs/index.html). Laboratory assignments not in _Experiments in Java_. 
  * [Homeworks](../Homeworks/index.html). A list of the assignments for the class, accompanied by their due dates 
  * [Quizzes](../Quizzes/index.html). The quizzes and surveys for this course. I don't always grade these. 
  * [Examples](../Examples/index.html). A list of examples generated for this class.

> ### _**Course Description:_**

>

> Introduction to Measurement and Statistics (PSYC 2750) is for the university
student who wishes to gain an understanding of basic statistical concepts.
Knowledge of these concepts is essential for the reading of technical journals
in one's field and basic research design. In other words, no matter whether
you are sitting by the fireplace catching up on your reading about depression
or working on a new treatment method, knowing when and how to use measurements
and statistics is fundamental. The basic concepts to be covered are:

>

>   1. the contrast between descriptive and causal research

>   2. types of measurement

>   3. the use of descriptive statistics to summarize research results

>   4. the use of inferential statistics to draw conclusions based on a
sample(s) drawn from a population.

>

> No prior statistical knowledge is required for this class. Classroom
techniques that will be used to achieve the course objectives will include
lecture, active problem solving sessions, homework, and examinations.

>

> This course is coded for the Scientific Understanding goal in the General
Education program. Scientific Understanding is defined as the analysis of the
concepts of a scientific discipline and its methods, limitations, and impact
in the modern world.

>

> This course is also coded for the Mathematics goal in the General Education
program. Mathematics is defined as the recognition of the value and beauty of
mathematics as well as the ability to appraise and use quantitative data.

>

> ### _**Course Objectives:_**

>

>   1. To develop a practicing and theoretical understanding of descriptive
and inferential statistics.

>

>   2. To develop an understanding of how to choose a statistic or determine
if the one used is appropriate based on the type or source of quantitative
data.

>

>   3. To develop an appreciation for the use of statistics and an ability to
recognize the misuse of statistics. In other words, to make the student an
active consumer of statistics (i.e. do people really lie with statistics?).

>

> ### _**Course Outcomes:_**

>

>   1. The student will have an understanding of basic research methodology
and the impact of research design on data interpretation.

>

>   2. The student will be able to differentiate between a descriptive and
inferential statistic and will know when each is being interpreted
appropriately.

>

>   3. The student will know how to represent and interpret frequency and
statistical data using basic graphing techniques.

>

>   4. The student will know how to compute and evaluate measures of central
tendency, measures of variability, standard scores, correlation coefficients,
linear regression, standard error, confidence intervals, t-tests (independent
and correlated), and one/two factor ANOVA.

>

>   5. The student will know when to appropriately use and how to interpret
data from each of the above statistical techniques.

>

>   6. The student will understand the underlying assumptions and theory of
hypothesis testing.

>

> ### _**NOTE:_**

>

> Statistics can be fun or at least they don't need to be feared. The logical
and mathematical concepts required to do well in this class are not
prohibitive for any health science or university student. The key to doing
well in this class can be summarized by two words, "KEEP UP!". If you don't
understand a concept in class, ask. I'm more than willing to re-explain. If
you start to fall behind, contact me as soon as possible. We'll make some
arrangements. This is important because the material discussed four weeks from
today will be based on material discussed today. For more survival tips, see

> ### _**Incoming Competencies/Prerequisites:_**

>

> Prerequisite: PSYC 1030 or permission of the instructor. All students should
be capable of basic math and simple algebra.

>

> ### _**Class Meetings:_**

>

> The class will meet on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 12:00 - 12:50.
**Attendance is strongly recommended as this material is difficult and
conceptually complex. Classroom attendance will greatly enhance your
understanding of the information.**

>

> ### _**Course Requirements:_**

>

> A midterm exam, a final exam, and homework assignments.

>

> All grades will be assigned on a scale of 0 - 100 with:

>

> 90 - 100| A,A-| Superior work  
> ---|---|---  
> 80 - 89| B+,B,B-| Good work  
> 70 - 79| C+,C,C- | Satisfactory work  
> 60 - 69| D+,D | Passing, but less than Satisfactory  
> Less than 60| F | Unsatisfactory  
>  
>> ### _**Percent of Grade:_**

>>

>> Midterm Exam | 40%  
>> ---|---  
>> Final Exam | 40%  
>> Homework | 20%  
>  
> Examination format will include short answer and problem solving. The
midterm will be take-home. The final will be in-class. The final will be open-
book and open-note. Each exam will constitute 40% of your final grade. All
exams must be taken on the date scheduled except in case of emergency. In case
of the above, the instructor must be notified. No make-up exams will be
provided if you fail to notify and discuss your situation with the instructor.
Please note that no extra credit work will be made available to make-up for a
poor test grade.

>

> Homework will be assigned for the material covered during lecture. This will
provide you with the opportunity to review and reinforce the material covered
in class. It also serves as a diagnostic tool for me to see where people might
be having problems. No late assignments will be accepted except in cases of
emergency. Homework will constitute 20% of your final grade. **Note** : Not
turning in homework assignments can result in a one to two letter grade drop
in your final grade.

>

> Plagiarism (attempting to pass of the work of another as one's own is not
acceptable and will result in a grade of 0 for that assignment and will be
turned over to the appropriate university source for disciplinary action. In
addition, cheating on exams will also result in the same fate.

>

> Late withdraws from this class will not be approved by the instructor except
in cases of emergency discussed with the instructor. No late withdraws will be
approved on the basis of poor class performance.

>

> This syllabus is subject to change at the instructor's discretion. All
changes concerning course requirements will be provided in writing. Changes
concerning exam dates may be made at the instructor's discretion and
communicated verbally to the class.

>

> It is understood that remaining in this course (not dropping or withdrawing
from this course) constitutes an agreement to abide by the terms outlined in
this syllabus and an acceptance of the requirements outlined in this document.
No grade of Incomplete will be issued for this course.

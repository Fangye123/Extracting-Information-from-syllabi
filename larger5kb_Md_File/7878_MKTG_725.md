**_I. Reading Materials:_**  
  
Required Text: _Basic Marketing Research_ , 3rd Edition, Gilbert A. Churchill  
  
Optional Text: _Statistics for Business and Economics_ , 6th Edition,
Anderson, Sweeney, and Williams (This is a text that many, if not all, of the
students should already own from their decision sciences coursework - if not,
virtually any basic statistics text should do)  
  
**_II. Pre requisite:_**  
  
DESC 650 and MKTG 650  
  
**_III. Course Description and Objectives:_**  
  
This is an introductory course in marketing research. The topic of marketing
research is a complex one. It involves a number of questions that need to be
answered and a number of decisions that need to be made with respect to the
choice of techniques used to solve a research problem. Decisions made with
respect to one stage in the research process have consequences for other
stages. Managers need an appreciation of the subtle and pervasive interactions
among the parts of the research process so that they can have the appropriate
degree of confidence in a particular research result. Researchers also need to
appreciate the interactions among the parts. The parts serve as "pegs" on
which to hang the knowledge accumulated about research methods. Researchers
need to resist the temptation of becoming enamored or the parts to the
detriment of the whole. This course attempts to serve both the aspiring
manager and the aspiring researcher by breaking the research process down into
some basic stages that must be completed when answering a research question.  
  
The specific stages (along which the course has been organized) are:  
  
1\. Formulate the problem  
  
2\. Determine research design  
  
3\. Determine data collection method  
  
4\. Design data collection forms  
  
5\. Design sample and collect data  
  
6\. Analyze and interpret the data  
  
7\. Prepare the research report  
  
Qualitative and quantitative skills and knowledge gained from this course are
important not only to those directly involved in marketing research, but also
to those who will be **managerial consumers** , or buyers, of marketing
research. By the end of the course, you should be able to competently review
and criticize research, appraise its usefulness to management, and have
experience with the research process.  
  
**_IV. Class Requirements and Policies:_**  
  
The classes will involve lecture, cases, and problem sets. Class participation
will be a substantial part of each student's final grade.  
  
_Cases_ :  
  
Where noted on the syllabus, we will spend about an hour covering cases in
case-method fashion. In these classes, I will call on students to answer
various questions about the case, and through class participation we will
solve the case. The case will be on material that we have covered in the
previous class, and will reinforce the principals covered in the earlier class
- one might call it "learning by doing." This method will help students better
understand and retain what was covered in lecture. **In addition, a write-up
of the case will be due the day the case is covered in class**.  
  
The cases will be solved by **groups** of students, and each group will be
responsible for turning a write-up of the case. Groups should consist of 3 to
4 students. Although each student will be graded independently for class
participation, the entire group will receive the same grade for the case
write-up. **By the beginning of the 2nd class, I need a list of all of the
groups and their members**.  
  
The written case analyses _should not exceed 4 pages in length_ - including
everything. The analyses will be marked-down if it exceeds this length. The
font should be 12 point. Later cases, involving questionnaire design or
statistical analyses can have questionnaire or statistical printout
attachments.  
  
_Problem Sets_ :  
  
Occasionally, I will assign problem sets based on exercises at the end of each
chapter. This will happen more in later classes. Again, the group will turn in
one set of solutions to the problem set, and each member of the group will
receive the same grade. In addition, **I may ask students in the class to
answer different problems from the set as we cover the material in class**. Be
prepared  - this is another component of your class participation grade.  
  
Quantitative analysis will be performed with Excel, which all students should
already own and know how to use.  
  
_Class Participation_ :  
  
Because class participation is an important part of the learning process
(especially with cases) and because it will help you develop communication
skills that you can use in the "real world," class participation will be a key
component of your final grade. Good participation is not primarily based on
quantity, but more on quality. Try to make comments that are relevant,
thought-provoking, and/or which stimulate further class discussion. While
these kinds of comments are not always possible, they should be a goal.
Consistently going for "air time," to the exclusion of content will cost you
an "A" in participation. Consistently **not participating** , or numerous
**absences** from class, will guarantee you a low grade in participation. I
recognize that students cannot always make class (e.g., because of illness,
job interviews, student activities, etc.), but I encourage you to attend
class. If you have 3 unexcused absences, your participation grade will be
lowered one-half letter grade (e.g., from B to B-). 4 will lower it one full
letter grade (e.g., from B to C). 5 will result in a D. 6 in an F. Given this
however, if you have extenuating circumstances, come see me _before the fact_
, and we can work something out.  
  
  
  
_Grading_ :  
  
Your final grade will be determined as follows:  
  
-Class participation 30%  
-Written Case Analyses   
and Problem Sets 40%  
-Final Presentation  
and Report 30%  
  
Grades will be assigned according to the following:  
  
A 90-100  
B 80-89  
C 70-79  
D 60-69  
F anything below 60  
  
*** No late assignments will be given full credit without prior arrangement.

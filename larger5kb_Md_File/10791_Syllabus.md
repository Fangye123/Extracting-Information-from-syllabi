Course Proposal  
  
German-Jewish Relations from the Age of Tolerance to Early Antisemitism  
  
Text: The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History, edited by Paul
Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz, 2nd Edition, Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 1995  
  
Course Description:  
  
An examination of the following aspects of German-Jewish culture: the movement
toward Jewish emancipation during the Enlightenment (18th century), the
emergence of political antisemitism (19th century), and the advent of early
Zionism (early 20th century). During the course of this semester, we will also
reflect on one of the major paradoxes of the modern age: why was Germany, the
land of the poets and philosophers and of finely developed humanistic
traditions also the land which perpetrated the Holocaust? By examining three
centuries worth of debates on the proper status of Jews in German society, we
will be in a better position to answer this question. Readings will include
literary works, philosophical treatises, political tracts, and a wide array of
historical and cultural documents thematizing German-Jewish relations at
differing junctures of history.

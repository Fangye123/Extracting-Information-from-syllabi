INTRODUCTION

This is a field-based course organized around a service learning model. It is
designed to integrate university study with hands-on service in the community.
Most activities will revolve around the work done in the field by students,
with the support of the instructor and the teaching assistant.

Our course objectives are to:

  1. Enhance the skills required for effective service work in community settings and gain valuable field experience at the same time.  
  

  2. Maximize our personal learning acquired in this way through sharing and analysis of field experience and through systematic efforts to understand and assess the effectiveness of our service work.  
  

  3. Relate lessons learned to other aspects of our university careers.  
  

The format is designed to accommodate differences in schedules, service site
locations, and service interests.

REQUIREMENTS

There are six basic requirements for this course:

  * Attend scheduled class sessions (on campus and in the field).   
  

  * Perform at least 30 hours of service work with your selected agency or community organization. (These hours must be signed off by the service provider, both to ensure you receive ServScript and for the purposes of this course.)  
  

  * Keep a journal of your fieldwork (guidelines for doing so will be provided).  
  

  * Read the required readings and participate in group discussions.  
  

  * Prepare a final project analyzing the nature and effectiveness of your work.  
  

  * Keep a positive mental attitude-we need your full cooperation in this course in order to get the most from our service learning experiences. In this class, everyone's ideas count!  
  

***If you know that you'll be unable to attend any given class session, you
must notify the instructor or teaching assistant beforehand!***

ACTIVITIES

Most of the course time will be devoted to your volunteer work in the
community. The instructor and teaching assistant, as well as the staff from
[the Center for Civic Education and Service
(CCES)](http://www.fsu.edu/~service/), will assist you in selecting your
service site and preparing for it. Initial class activities will facilitate
your efforts to:

  * Get to know an organization serving the community-how it functions, its philosophy, purpose, the people who staff it, and its clients;   
  

  * Interview organization members and possibly its stakeholders in the community;  
  

  * Identify service needs and what role(s) you can play in helping to meet them; and  
  

  * Propose how you can assist the organization to carry out its mission more effectively  
  

After selecting service projects, students will set up their schedules and do
service work with the agency of their choice on a regular (usually weekly)
basis. Class sessions will be held at various points in the semester to help
students become more effective service providers and assess the factors that
determine the value of such work for the volunteer, the agency, and the
intended beneficiaries. Several special on-site visits will also be conducted
during the semester.

Another important on-going activity will be keeping a reflective journal
during the semester. Tips on how to keep a good journal will be offered in
class. Additionally, group discussions will play an important role in this
course-topics for discussion should also be helpful for your journal work.
Reflection is essential in this kind of course, so we will create
opportunities to reflect as a group and as individuals.

READING MATERIALS

There will be no textbook for this course, but there is a short list of key
articles on service learning. These informative articles will give you some
general background information on what service learning is. There are also
some very interesting articles on service learning agencies and volunteers'
experiences-hopefully, these will motivate and inspire you in your own work.
All articles will be handed out in class.

Some of the most important reading you will be doing, however, will not
involve the printed word at all. During your service work, you will also be
engaged in what Brazilian educator Paulo Freire called "reading the world."
Reading the world simply means studying with all our senses through daily
experience in order to understand the real forces at work, which may not
always appear on the surface.

SERVICE OPTIONS

Site-based volunteer work is required of each student. Students may choose the
agency they wish to assist. For students who have not chosen a service site,
the placement services available at [ CCES](http://www.fsu.edu/~service/) (930
W. Park Ave, **644-3342** ) are strongly recommended. CCES has arrangements
with dozens of community service providers and can match students with
agencies that work in areas of student interest.

CCES also sponsors service-learning projects, and students may satisfy their
service requirement through participation in one of these projects.
Information on these projects will be provided during the orientation at CCES
during the first class.

Service activities should include:

  * Learning about the service organization, its clients, and the context for the needs and services being addressed (including on-site training by the service organization),
  * Direct interaction with clients, 
  * Evaluation by agency staff, 
  * A variety of responsibilities, and
  * Opportunities for some decision making by students

Students should select projects in their areas of educational, personal,
and/or professional interests. Service activities should steer away from
**solely** clerical tasks such as typing, copying, and answering telephones.

FINAL PROJECT

The purpose of the final project is to prompt you to reflect on the results of
your service learning experiences and to assess:

  * What worked 
  * What did not work 
  * What factors explain your successes and failures and those of the agency with which you are working 
  * How the experience could be made more valuable in the future; and
  * The impact of your service on the agency, the agency's clients, and you. 

We ask you in the final project-either individually or in small teams-to sum
up the results of your service learning experience. Your job is to help us
better understand the value of this type of service delivery (and possibly how
it can be made more useful to the intended beneficiaries) and how the course
itself can be made more meaningful to those who will take it in the future.

The project can take the shape of a final paper, an oral presentation, a
visual presentation, or some combination of any of these three. The paper, or
outline of the presentation, is due in class by the next-to-last week of
classes, and actual presentations will be made at the last class session.
Papers should be 4 - 7 double-spaced pages in length for each author (8 - 14
pages for a two-person team, etc.) and 12 or 14 size type font. Oral or visual
presentation should reflect an equivalent level of preparation and thought.
Fuller guidelines for this work will be discussed in class.

GRADING

Grades will be assigned by the instructor on the basis of written assessment
of the student's performance.

An honest and committed effort to satisfy all course requirements with quality
and evidence of genuine personal investment in the service learning
opportunity will earn an "A." All students are able to achieve an "A." This
course is not graded on the curve.

The various requirements of the course will be weighted in the following way
in establishing grades:

40% | For accomplishment of requisite service learning hours in the community.  
---|---  
20% | For class attendance and quality of participation.  
20% | For quality of journaling effort.  
20% | For quality of final project effort.  
  
Both the teaching assistant and instructor will be available to meet with
individuals or teams to discuss the progress of their work. In addition, each
student will have one meeting (at the service learning site or on-campus) with
the teaching assistant during the course of the semester, so that instructors
can get a first-hand sense of how things are going.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

Reasonable accommodation for students with disabilities may be arranged by
contacting the instructor on an individual basis early in the semester. This
syllabus, for example, can be made available in an alternate format upon
request.

This course examines the history of women in Europe from the eighteenth
century to the twentieth. As a 400-level history course, it requires a serious
commitment of time and effort. All readings listed on the syllabus are
required, and students must be prepared to participate in class sessions.

_Written Requirements_ : Two papers plus midterm and final essay exams. The
first paper (3-5 pages) will be assigned based on the course reading. The
second paper of 8-10 pages will require outside research. Short writing
assignments in class are not graded individually but form part of my
assessment of participation.

_Classroom Requirements_ : Reading assignments are due by the first class
meeting of the week unless otherwise noted (and except for the first week of
class). Regular attendance and participation are required and will be
considered in the computation of grades. Students who miss more than one class
will be required to hand in a 1-page summary of the reading. Please bring
books to class for consultation and discussion. Each student will give an oral
presentation based on research for the second paper.

_Grades_ : Grades will be assigned on a scale of A, A-, B+, etc., and will be
based on the two papers (20% and 25%), midterm (20%) final exam (20%), and
class participation (15%).

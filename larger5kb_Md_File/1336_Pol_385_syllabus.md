### **_Prospectus:_**

Post-authoritarian democracies inherit, among other things, a history of
extensive human rights violations. What is the best way to prosecute such
violations? Is this a matter for the world, in the form of an international
criminal court, or one best left to a nation? And what policy would be best:
trial, bureaucratic purges, reparations, general amnesty, or commissions of
truth and reconciliation? This course will focus on post-WWII democracies in
Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. It will examine comparatively the
strengths and weaknesses of these different policies.



###  **_Contact Information_**

My office is Eliot 404. My office hours this term will be on (Hours TBA) or by
appointment. My telephone extension is 7346. My preferred mode of
communication with you will be e-mail so check your email regularly.



###  **_Requirements:_**

The readings will be extensive, difficult, and challenging to understand and
work with. Constructive conference participation will be expected throughout
the course. This will go beyond speaking occasionally. I may ask for your
thoughts in writing on a particular issue for the next session or I may divide
you up into discussion groups.

Finally, this course will have three (3) assignments. The first is a
literature review on a particular topic you propose to examine. This will be
due just before fall break. I will spell out what this exercise requires in a
separate handout. The second is an exam which will come on the 10th week of
classes, that is, just before Thanksgiving. The exam will draw on the lectures
as well as the course materials. For the third assignment, you have a choice.
You may either elect to write a second literature review (thus improving your
skills at doing a research review) or you may choose to write a full research
paper based on an aspect of your first literature review. A description of
what the second option involves can be found in Appendix B of the Political
Science Handbook. _If you plan to complete the Political Science junior
research paper requirement in this course you must indicate so immediately._
Students setting out to complete the junior research paper requirement in
Political Science will find the second option quite compatible with the
Department's requirements.

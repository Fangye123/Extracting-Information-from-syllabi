###  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

## COURSE PURPOSE:

#### This is an interdisciplinary course that introduces you to the cultures
and societies of Latin America. In each section of the course you gain an
appreciation for the major topics, themes, and processes that shape Latin
America. You benefit from the unique perspectives and insights that each
discipline has to offer. Each participating instructor has a broad and deep
level of interest and experience in the region, which serves to enrich the
learning process. This course satisfies Category E of the University's General
Education requirements.

### **REQUIRED READING** :

#### (1) Keeling, David J. (1997) _Contemporary Argentina: A Geographical
Perspective_. Available at the College Bookstores (probably shelved under
GEOG200 or LAS200) plus  
(2) _Focus_ , Vol. 45(4) Summer 1999, Special Magazine Issue on "Brazil" by
Brian Godfrey,  
(3) A course packet available at Lemox (ask for LAS200-Keeling).

### GRADING:

#### There are three exams in this course: two one-hour section exams and the
final two-hour exam, all of which are multiple choice, critical thinking
format. Each section exam is worth 25% (125 points) and the final exam is
worth 30% (150 points). Fifty (50) bonus points are allocated proportionately
to the highest of your three exam scores. Attendance and participation are
expected and are required, and are crucial to your success in this course. Ten
percent of the course grade (50 points) is allocated for attendance and
participation. Total points available for the course equal 500. Grades are
allocated as follows: A = 90-100%; B = 80-89.9%; C = 70-79.9%; D = 60-69.9%; F
=<60%.

### **ATTENDANCE POLICY:**

#### Please make every effort to come to class on time. The class ends at 3:15
pm, so do not begin packing up materials until the appropriate time as it
disturbs other students. If you attend class the instructor will assume that
you are present to learn the course materials, not to talk with your
neighbors, read the newspaper, or do homework for another class. If these
rules are not to your liking, I urge you to drop the course immediately and
take something else. Those students who attend regularly generally get more
from the course than students who miss class. Absences (both excused and
unexcused) will have a negative effect on your grade. Excused absences are
given only for offical academic/university related activities that are
communicated to the instructor BEFORE the beginning of class, or for special
DOCUMENTED situations (illness, e.g.). All exams must be completed as
scheduled in order to pass the course. Make-up exams are given only under VERY
SPECIAL circumstances. Students are reminded that they are only allowed to
sign THEIR OWN NAME to the attendance sheet.  
** NOTE: Latin American Studies 200 strictly adheres to the course drop policy
found in the Undergraduate and Graduate catalogs. It is the sole
responsibility of individual students to meetthe cited deadlines for dropping
a course. In exceptional cases the deadline for schedule changes(dropping a
course) may be waived. The successful waiver will require a written
description ofextenuating circumstances and relevant documentation. Poor
academic performance, general malaise, or undocumented general stress factors
are NOT considered legitimate extenuatingcircumstances. Since the granting of
such waivers is rare, we urge you to follow the established guidelines.

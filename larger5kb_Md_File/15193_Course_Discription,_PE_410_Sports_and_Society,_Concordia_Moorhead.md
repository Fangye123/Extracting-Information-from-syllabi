**Course Objectives:** To carefully examine, in a multi-disciplinary seminar
format, major issues connected with the emergence of sport as a significant,
and often negative, element in modern society, and what reforms or directions
might be appropriate in making sport a more positive aspect of modern life.

**Integration Requirement:**

As an integration course at Concordia, PE-410 students will be expected to
bring a variety of disciplines to the task of examining modern sport as it is
practiced and organized in the U.S. and internationally. Although the text is
written primarily from a sociological and physical education perspective,
students will be expected to call upon such fields as economics, physiology,
psychology, the humanities, journalism, education, biology and law in working
through the issues addressed in the class.

##  Informed Lively Discussion:

The success of a student's participation in this class will be greatly
affected by her or his willingness to bring informed and thoughtful input to
the class discussions. That will require both preparation and a willingness to
engage in lively discussion on multifaceted issues that can often stir strong
emotions, as well as honest intellectual differences of opinion. Students will
not be judged on whether or not they agree with the
[instructor](http://www.cord.edu/dept/sports/pyle.html) on any issue, but
rather on the substance of their scholarship and their willingness to engage
in a serious examination of competing points of view and positions.

**Course Requirements and Grading:**

**Class Discussion, Team participation, Attendance, General Daily
Preparation**

This includes team participation in ten presentations on the [reform
questions](41001ll.html) that will be debated.

Also you must provide a URL to a relevant research or media article on each
[issue](41001ll.html), preferably in support of your team's position on that
issue. The new link must be posted on the [class discussion
board](http://www.cord.edu/faculty/pyle/pedagogy/99410/board/wwwboard/) on the
web no later than 24 hours prior to the beginning of each presentation.)

Your grade for the class will be based 50 percent on your [written
contributions](410tpres.html) to the class and 50% on your oral contributions
to the[class
discussions](http://www.cord.edu/faculty/pyle/pedagogy/99410/p1notes410.html).

**Other Requirements:**  
\- This class relies heavily on student participation in the learning process.
You owe it to both yourself and your classmates to be present. A maximum of 2
unexcused absences. Each additional absence will lead to a one letter
reduction in grade.  
\- The quality of your writing will affect your grade. If you don't care
enough to use good grammar, spell check, and write in complete sentences then
you shouldn't submit the paper.  
\- Lack of preparation for a class discussion will be treated as an unexcused
absence.  
\- Violation of Concordia's Academic Integrity Policies will result in a
failing grade.

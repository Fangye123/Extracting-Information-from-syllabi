**The U.S. Survey Course on the Web**

In July 1998, the American Social History Project and the Center for History
and New Media at George Mason University are launching the prototype of a new
website, [**History Matters**](http://historymatters.gmu.edu). The website,
which has been developed with support from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation,
provides college and high-school teachers with unusual and effective
curriculum materials and teaching resources about the U.S. past. Organized in
conjunction with our [ New Media Classroom](index_new.html) project, the
**History Matters** website will be fully operational in Fall 1998 and will
offer:  
  
---|---  
  
  
|  **WWW.HISTORY** \-- An annotated list of over 300 history-rich Web sites

 **DIGITAL BLACKBOARD** \-- Teaching assignments that utilize existing Web
resources ranging from analyzing free black registries in nineteenth century
Virginia to role-playing exercises about dam building under the TVA.

**MANY PASTS** \-- Approximately 80 primary source documents (including 24
oral histories) that convey the experiences of  "ordinary" Americans in the
past to enhance teachers' presentation of social history and assist students
in their research and writing assignments.

**UNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS** \-- An interactive feature that explores the
historian's craft, analyzing diverse types of evidence.

**ELECTRONIC ESSAYS** \-- Short hypertext pieces that use a wide range of
website materials to address specific topics in U.S. history

**STUDENTS AS HISTORIANS** \-- Provides links to student work on the Web as
well as a space for teachers to post students' work and comment on the process
of using Web production as a teaching tool.

**PAST MEETS PRESENT** \-- Articles and resources that help teachers link
events of the past with current issues and events.

**SYLLABUS CENTRAL** \-- A sampling of annotated syllabi that present
approaches to teaching the U.S. history survey using new technology.

**TALKING HISTORY** \-- A discussion forum that will begin in Fall 1998 for
teachers and students to talk about studying the past. We are planning
moderated discussions led by prominent scholars in key fields such as women's
history, cultural history, and the Civil War and Reconstruction that address
content and pedagogy.

**WHAT'S NEW?** \-- A guide to new resources available on the HM site.

News_** |  **ASHP'S** **[MAKING CONNECTIONS](MC.html) PROGRAM AWARDED BOARD OF
EDUCATION CONTRACT**

This past fall, ASHP's program [**Making Connections: Literacy Building Across
the Humanities Curriculum**](MC.html) was awarded a 3-year contract totaling
$1.2 million by the New York City Board of Education. Formerly known as the
ASHP High School Collaboration, **Making Connections** is now in its ninth
year and provides multimedia curriculum materials and intensive professional
development services to 6,000 students and more than 100 teachers in 45 New
York City public high schools. Together with continued funding from CUNY's
Office of Academic Affairs, the new, multi-year contract with the Board of
Education provide more enduring support to participating schools, teachers,
and students.

![](images/nmcnet.gif) | **NEW MEDIA CLASSROOM REGIONAL CENTERS, 1998-99**

ASHP/CML in collaboration with the [American Studies Association's Crossroads
Project](http://www.georgetown.edu/crossroads/about.html) is proud to announce
the selection of Regional Centers as part of the development of the second
phase of the **New Media Classroom** program for the 1998-99 school year.

[**The New Media Classroom: Building a National Conversation on Narrative,
Inquiry, and Technology in the U.S. History Survey**](index_new.html) (NMC) is
a humanities focused, teaching-with-technology faculty development program
that serves over 25 educators from schools and colleges across the country.
Sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the W. K. Kellogg
Foundation, NMC provides faculty with an opportunity to explore the use of new
educational technology resources found on the World Wide Web and CD-ROMs in
the teaching and learning of American history and culture.

After holding summer institutes with teachers from across the country in 1996
and 1997, this next phase of NMC turns to extending this national network
through the active participation of local teachers. The 1998-99 program will
start with six parallel regional institutes in June, July, and August 1998.
Each institute will provide local school and college faculty opportunities to
evaluate new media as a tool in rethinking the U.S. History or comparable
interdisciplinary humanities survey course and, more broadly, explore the role
of new media and inquiry-based learning in the teaching of humanities courses.
The six centers are located in the following schools and colleges across the
country:

Millersville University (Millersville, Pennsylvania)  
Pembroke Hill School (Kansas City, Missouri)  
Washington State University (Pullman, Washington)  
Tulsa Community College (Tulsa, Oklahoma)  
City University of New York (New York, New York)  
Mt. Greylock High School (Williamstown, Massachusetts)

During the ensuing school year faculty participants will implement new
teaching and learning skills developed during the summer institute in their
Fall courses, and coordinate two faculty development workshops to expand the
impact of the program on their home campus. Faculty will also participate in a
national on-line seminar as a means to promote reflective practice, share
resources, and help each other develop leadership skills to guide and assist
their schools in planning for and taking advantage of new electronic tools.

In concert with a diverse group of history and humanities educators, media
producers, scholars, and professional development leaders, the **New Media
Classroom** aims to foster collective expertise among humanities faculty in
new media-based instruction and and to help build a national network that
disseminates knowledge about and practical approaches to new educational
technology to teachers and students nationwide.

program in your area, please contact:

  |  [**THE NEW MEDIA LAB**](www.ashp.cuny.edu/ashp/nml)

In 1996-97 the City University of New York Central Office provided seed funds
to help ASHP/CML launch a [**New Media Lab**](www.ashp.cuny.edu/ashp/nml)
(NML) at the Graduate School. The Lab is a collaborative effort to explore the
possibilities of applying high end computer applications to educational issues
and problems. Co-directed by ASHP/CML Executive Director Stephen Brier and
Professor Brian Schwartz of the Graduate School's Ph.D. Program in Physics,
the NML will ultimately be based at the Graduate School's new facility at the
former B. Altman site on Fifth Avenue when it opens in the Summer of 1999. In
the two years prior to completion of the Altman renovation, CUNY graduate
students employed by the Lab are working at ASHP/CML offices in Tribeca using
two Digital Alpha workstations running SoftImage animation software to develop
several graphic intensive multimedia projects in science, art, and the
humanities for the World Wide Web, CD-ROM, and video. One such project is
ASHP's [_The Lost Museum,_](http://www.ashp.cuny.edu/LM) an exploration of
historical environments: the prototype, currently under virtual
reconstruction, is a section of P. T. Barnum's American Museum, New York
City's mid-nineteenth-century emporium of edification and entertainment. We
are also working with Ira Flato, host of NPR's _Science Friday_ program and
his staff, to develop several science education projects aimed at the general
public, including an animated video program on the history of the transistor
and a Web site on the physics of automobile traffic patterns.

NML Directors Brier and Schwartz will develop ties to a number of other CUNY
campuses (including Baruch College and Brooklyn College) to work with CUNY
faculty and staff interested in developing computer-based applications that
employ sophisticated new media software and hardware for both educational and
business purposes. We also plan to place special emphasis on establishing
links to the growing number of new media companies in the "Silicon Alley" area
of Manhattan interested in using the NML's high-end equipment and in working
with CUNY faculty and students.

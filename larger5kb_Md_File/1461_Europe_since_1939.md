**  Europe since 1939**

 The history of Europe since 1939 has suffered not only from the usual
problems which arise in the study and teaching of the very recent past--
politicization, excessive proximity to our own time, unavailability of primary
and even secondary sources--but also as a result of the divisions of the
continent itself.  Consequently, much of the experiences common to the
continent as a whole--the impact of war, collaboration and resistance, the
post-war reorganization of states and societies; the modernization of rural
economies; developed and underdeveloped regions, shifts back and forth between
national, regional, and international identity; generational and ideological
conflicts, and memories, mis-memories and historiographical conflicts over the
recent past--have been lost in the distorting emphasis upon a single, East-
West division.  In this class, we will read and discuss the recent history of
Europe with the goal of integrating the study of East and West with an eye to
the commonalities and not the differences.

**  Writing Assignment**

 The primary goal of this assignment is to allow you to do history the same
way as historians do--to examine primary and secondary sources in order to
answer questions about the past. One of the most easily understandable and
compelling forms of history is the biography and your assignment is the
writing of a 10-15 biography of a significant figure, but not a "great"
figure, whose life is lived between 1939 and the present.  
     This assignment is divided into three parts:  1) Selection of person, brief description of individual, their historical significance and secondary sources available; 2) Biographical entry with primary and secondary sources reviewed; 3) The paper. 

**Part I (50 points).   Selection of Person (2-3 pages, double-spaced)  Due
September 21**

Chose a person from European history between 1939 and the present.  In essay
form, 1) provide a brief, but clear description of the person and their
significance, i.e. who or what, when, and where.  In order to provide a
coherent and clear description, you must have examined closely at  least two
secondary historical studies and one scholarly article that relates
specifically to your person. A biography is the obvious choice, but a study or
article examining a specific political, cultural, social, and/or intellectual
movement with which the individual was associated is acceptable. General texts
are not acceptable;   2)  Summarize briefly the content and major points of
each of the secondary sources;  3)  How does this individual's life illustrate
themes and issues explored in this course.

**Part II (100 points).   Biographical entry with primary and secondary
sources reviewed.  (4-5 pages, double spaced)  Due October 26**

 You will write a complete biographical entry, highlighting significant
milestones and events in the person's life.  In addition, you are to seek out
at least 2 primary sources written or produced by your person and at least 3
other primary sources that help to illuminate the movement, event, or issue
the person has lived through.  These primary sources must help you flush out
the person's life.  (For this part, look at the type of evidence the
historians used in their biographies and studies).  In an essay, provide
specific information about each source:  What kind of document is it?  Who or
what produced it and when?  What information do your sources convey?  How can
this information be used to write about this person's life.  


**Part III (150 points).   The Biography  (10-15 pages, double-spaced). First
Draft due November 16; Final Paper Due December 3**

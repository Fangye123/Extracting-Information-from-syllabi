> There are 500 possible class points in this class. Let's assume that a
student earned the following grades in HS 101. This is how the student's grade
would be calculated. The student earned a 71 on exam 1, an 89 on exam 2, a 78
on exam 3, a 90 on the term paper and 98 on the on-line quizzes. The student
therefore earned a total of 426 class points. 426 divided by 500 equals 85.2
which rounds down to an 85. This hypothetical student would have earned a B in
this class. **

>

> ****Statement on Late Papers, Exams, and Classroom Decourum:** **

>

> **Late papers, exams, and quizzes will be subject to a 10% grade reduction,
papers, exams and quizzes are considered late if they are not submitted to the
college by e-mail by the close of the business day (4:30 p.m.) on Thursday of
the week the subject matter is covered in class. Because this is a college
class, on-line language is expected to be of a mature and non-offensive
nature. Student work that is more than two weeks, late will not be accepted
for a grade at all; barring extenuating circumstances that the instructor is
made aware of in advance of the two week deadline. **

>

> ****Statement on Academic Integrity:** **

>

> **All work turned in for grading is expected to be your own original work.
Plagiarism is unacceptable. **

>

> ****Statement on BMCC's Cultural Activities:** **

>

> **Because BMCC is a tribally sponsored Community College, participation by
the student body in various cultural activities enhances both student and
faculty awareness of Native American culture. Some of these activities are
pot-luck dinners, talking circles, and ceremonial drumming to name a few. All
members of the BMCC community are encouraged to attend these activities that
are practiced on a college wide basis. Although many on-line students may not
be able to attend, due to distance from the campus, please know that, if you
are in the area and wish to attend any cultural activities, you are very
welcome to do so. **

**General Course Objective:**

**The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the principles of science
education and some of the many methods and activities needed to begin teaching
science in the elementary school. Although there is some science content in
the course, it is not meant to stand alone as the source of science knowledge
required to teach quality science in the elementary schools. It is assumed
that you have studied some college level science.**

**This course will consist of lectures, discussions, readings, hands-on minds-
on activities, demonstrations, group activities, peer teaching, displays, as
well as lab assignments and exams.**

**Specific Course Objectives:**

**The preparation of educational personnel at the University of Nevada-Reno is
based upon a conceptual framework. The foundation of this framework is divided
into four categories (love of learning, develop a fund of knowledge,
engagement in reflective practice, and value democracy and diversity) and
guides the planning and delivery of specific courses and the program as a
whole.**

**The following goals/objectives have been developed to reflect the
relationship of this course to that conceptual framework. Upon successful
completion of the requirements of this course, the student will be able to:**

**Value democracy and diversity:**

**1\. demonstrate an understanding of the customs of the culture by
distinguishing among the nature and roles of science, technology, and society
and their integration within an elementary science program.**

**Love of learning:**

**2\. develop an understanding of learning, developmental, and conceptual
change theories used in the construction of scientific knowledge and their
implementation within an elementary science program; and**

**3\. demonstrate knowledge of subject matter by enhancing elementary
preservice teachers' understanding of the nature of science, capacity to
develop experimental designs, and ability to collect and interpret both
qualitative and quantitative data.**

**Develop a fund of knowledge:**

**4\. acquaint preservice elementary teachers with the historical development,
current goals, and curricular expectations as recognized by the National
Science Education Standards**

**5\. develop quality elementary science lessons through interdisciplinary
approaches, integrated math/science curricula, and alternative instructional
strategies for oral presentation, demonstration, and "hands-on" lessons;**

**6\. promote competency development in the areas of: (a) assessment of
print/non-print materials for selection in instruction; (b) daily
instructional planning; and (c) unit instructional planning on selected
Unified science topics;**

**7\. facilitate competency development in the realms of: (a) matching
appropriate learning activities with elementary grade levels; (b) assessing
and modifying learning activities for use in multicultural environments; and
(c) diversifying learning activities consistent with a holistic K-6
curriculum; and**

**8\. demonstrate use of the LEARNING CYCLE (5-E model) as a model for lesson
planning in science that incorporates content objectives, process objectives,
hands-on Engagement & Exploration, teacher questioning techniques to assist
students toward self-discovery or Explanation, and provides students with
opportunities to Elaborate & Evaluate discovered concepts.**

**Engagement in reflective practice:**

**9\. foster among preservice elementary science teachers, the ability to
perform reflective thought, self-analysis, and critical thinking with respect
to effective and efficient methods for teaching elementary science; and**

**10\. enhance among preservice elementary teachers, a reduced anxiety
regarding and a more positive attitude toward science as an instructional area
of the elementary school curriculum.**

**The conceptual framework is also based upon the standards below that were
developed**  
**by Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC).(Copied
from: How To Develop A Professional Portfolio: A Manual For Teachers, Campbell
(et al) 1997,**  
**Allyn & Bacon.)**

**Standard# I -Knowledge of Subject Matter**  
**The teacher understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and
structure of the discipline(s) he or she teaches and can create learning
experiences that make these aspects of subject matter meaningful for
students.**

**_Standard #2 - Knowledge of Human Development and Learning_**  
**The teacher understands how children learn and develop, and can provide
learning opportunities that support their intellectual, social, and personal
development.**

**Standard #3 \- Adapting Instruction for Individual Needs**  
**The teacher understands how students differ in their approaches to learning
and creates instructional opportunities that are adapted to diverse learners.
_Standard #4 - Multiple Instructional Strategies_**  
**The teacher understands and uses a variety of instructional strategies to
encourage students' development of critical thinking, problem solving, and
performance skills.**

**_Standard #5 - Classroom Motivation and Management Skills_**  
**The teacher uses an understanding of individual and group motivation and
behavior to create a learning environment that encourages positive social
interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation.**

**_Standard #6 - Communication Skills_**  
**The teacher uses knowledge of effective verbal, nonverbal, and media
communication techniques to foster active inquiry, collaboration, and
supportive interaction in the classroom.**

**_Standard #7 - Instructional Planning Skills_**  
**The teacher plans instruction based on knowledge of subject matter,
students, the community, and curriculum goals.**

**_Standard #8 - Assessment of Student Learning_**  
**The teacher understands and uses formal and informal assessment strategies
to ensure the continuous intellectual, social, and physical development of the
learner.**

**_Standard #9 - Professional Commitment and Responsibility,_**  
**The teacher is a reflective practitioner who continually evaluates the
effects of his or her choices and actions on others (students, parents, and
other professionals in the learning community), and who actively seeks out
opportunities to grow professionally.**

**This course meets all the objectives as stated above.**

**WEEKLY INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES**

**LECTURE**

**(A) To introduce the background required, as well as illustrative
demonstrations related to the development and use of a variety of science
process skills.**

**(B) To introduce, assess, and apply descriptive information related to
science teaching methodology.**

**(C) To foster a conceptual understanding of the Learning Cycle as an
instructional model for science teaching.**

**LABORATORY**

**To provide opportunities to apply science process skills through the use of
manipulative materials. The lab materials selected will be examples of those
thatare typically available in the elementary schools. The expectation is that
students will emerge from this course with a more sophisticated understanding
of a process approach to science that can be implemented in future teaching
experiences.**

**University of Nevada - Reno Statement on Academic Honesty:**

**Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by failure
on an exam, paper or project, failure in the course and/or expulsion from UNR.
Refer to the academic dishonesty policy in the UNR Student Handbook.**

**SOME IMPORTANT NOTES**

**1\. All assignments are due at the designated times. There are no
exceptions. Assignments not on time will not be accepted. Very soon you will
be responsible for a classroom of students and you will have to be ready on
time each day: getting assignments in on time is good preparation. Of course,
assignments may be turned in early.**

**2\. Assignments are to be free of grammar and spelling errors. CHECK YOUR
WORK FOR ERRORS! PROOF-READ YOUR WORK! Typing is REQUIRED for all essays and
when indicated on take home tests. A computer lab is located in the Education
Building. Assignments are to have a professional appearance and quality. This
does not imply that you should spend your valuable time creating fascinating
covers. PLEASE, NO COVERS ON THE WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS!!**

**Include your name, day of class or lab, and the date the assignment was
turned in on the first page. EXAMPLE: John R. Cannon, Wednesday - 7:00, May
10, 1992.**

**3\. All examinations will be discussed before being taken so that all
questions/concerns you might have may be answered. I will not pull some
obscure point from the readings to confound you on an exam.**

**4\. Attendance is required for ALL LABORATORIES. Failure to attend will
result in lowering your final course grade! You are adults and responsible for
the decisions you make. The supervisors in your school will expect your
attendance as do I, so... continue to practice professionalism now.**

**COURSE ASSIGNMENTS OVERVIEW**

**A. Bottle Biology Project -- Example, click[
here](http://unr.edu/homepage/jcannon/364bottbio.html) **

**Each student will do a Bottle Biology project for the entire semester. The
columns will be displayed in lab for sharing at semester's end. The plants and
organisms to be grown are the student's choice. In addition to the column, a
write-up must also be turned in describing the type of life found in the
column, measurements of growth, and general observations for 30 continuous
days.**

**B. Science Television Programs Reviews**

**An important part of becoming a professional involves staying current in the
information in your field of expertise. One easy way to do this is to watch
for science programming on television networks, i.e., PBS, The Learning
Channel, Major non-cable networks, ABC, CBS, NBC. Choose 3 programs and write
a review that answers:**

**1\. Thesis of the program**  
**2\. Brief program review**  
**3\. What I learned**  
**4\. How I might use this information in my classroom**

**The reviews should be NO LONGER than 2 pages and turned in for credit
whenever completed.**

**C. Monthly Calendars -- all 12 months**

**One NON-RETURNABLE copy of all months (all months must be included)goes to
Dr. Cannon. Each lab group will design and turn in a year's worth of calendars
that can be used as handouts sent home with children or displayed in the
classroom. The calendars should be labeled only with the days of the week (no
dates) with bi- or tri-weekly activities, and a letter to the parents on the
back. See samples in class. Ask Dr. Cannon to show you some.**

**D. Learning Cycle Unit Lesson Plans -- 5 days worth**

**[See example learning cycle
template](http://unr.edu/homepage/jcannon/lc2000.html) on the CI 365 web page.
ALL LEARNING CYCLES MUST BE SAVED ON A 3.5" DISKETTE and turned in as hard
copy also to be graded and returned to you.**

**E. Field Work with _real_ children -- spring field trips. Participation is
REQUIRED. Failure to participate will result in an INCOMPLETE for the final
course grade.**

**F. Science Teaching Web Page Development -- The World Wide Web is quickly
becoming a major professional development resource for teachers of all levels.
So that you have some experience in working the web, you are required to
develop your own science teaching web page. The page must include:**

**1\. Your name**  
**2\. Philosophy of science teaching**  
**3\. At least 10 WWW links to sites related to science content or teaching
with a brief description of each link and why YOU think it's a cool place to
go to for information.**

**G. Vee Diagrams \-- due before class each week; based upon previous demo!
Get a hard copy from Dr. Cannon.**

Theme: "Celebration of Science Learning - Heat Transfer and It's Impact Upon
Food Consumption!"

Heat, in physics, transfer of energy from one part of a substance to another,
or from one body to another by virtue of a difference in temperature. Heat is
energy in transit; it always flows from a substance at a higher temperature to
the substance at a lower temperature, raising the temperature of the latter
and lowering that of the former substance, provided the volume of the bodies
remains constant. Heat does not flow from a lower to a higher temperature
unless another form of energy transfer, work, is also present. See also
Power." (from Microsoft Encarta
[http://encarta.msn.com](http://encarta.msn.com/) )

Since the final is over the lunch hour, let's have a winnie roast! Dr. Cannon
will bring winnies, buns, and all the fixings. Please bring something to share
with the class. You must attend the final as per course guidelines from UNR.

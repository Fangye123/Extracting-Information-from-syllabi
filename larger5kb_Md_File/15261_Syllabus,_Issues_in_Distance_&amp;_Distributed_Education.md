**_Course Overview_**

**This course intends to examine issues related to distance and distributed
learning at all levels of education. In addition to exploring selected
telecommunications technologies used in the design and execution of education-
at-a-distance, students will join the instructor in researching and discussing
collateral issues.**

**Class sessions will include demonstrations of:**

  * **the University's interactive full-motion video facility**
  * **compressed video technologies**
  * **Internet-centered educational distribution, including:**
    * **asynchronous tools:**
      * **distributed e-mail**
      * **interactive forms**
      * **WWW threaded discussion boards**
    * **synchronous communications devices:**
      * **live interactive chat applications**
      * **Internet video conferencing** 

**Additionally, the relative merits and drawbacks of large scale distance
learning systems, such as satellite teaching and broadcast systems, will be
explored and discussed.**

**Equally significant will be the examination of the following key issues of
policy and practice:**

  * **instructional design**
  * **student support**
  * **faculty development and support**
  * **workplace questions:**
    * **time for development and reflection**
    * **compensation**
    * **copyright**
    * **the ownership of intellectual property** 

  * **learning efficacy**
  * **institutional funding, promotion and investment**
    * **supporting institutional mission**
    * **costs versus benefits**
    * **strategies for securing return on investment**
  * **the politics of design, construction and implementation** 

**Please have _at least one_ 3.5" DS/HD disk with you for every class and all
lab work.**

* * *

**_Course Format_**

**This course will be conducted primarily as a seminar. Students will be
expected to join the instructor conducting, presenting and leading discussion
on a variety of curricular, instructional, technological and policy issues
related to the overall course topic. For some class sessions, actual
demonstrations of distance and distributed learning techniques are planned.**  
  

* * *

_**Course Readings and Resources**_

**The major course text will be Schrum, L ([click here for home
page](http://itech1.coe.uga.edu/Faculty/lschrum/Lynne'shome.html)) and
Berenfeld, B. ([Click here for example of
work](http://www.edc.org/FSC/NCIP/TC_Global-Lab.HTML)). [Teaching and Learning
in the Information Age: A Guide to Educational
Telecommunications](http://www.abacon.com/books/ab_0205198015.html), Boston:
Allyn & Bacon (1997). **

**Relevant resources are cited with interactive links in theClass Schedule
section of this syllabus. These form an essential part of the expected course
reading.  With the help of the instructor, peers and the increasingly powerful
Internet research tools, students are expected to seek and find resources
germane to their particular needs and project requirements.**

**Significant additional research on the Internet and through the University
Library will also be required. Students will be expected to assume major
responsibility for a significant course topic, to present research results,
and to lead class discussion.**

_**Course Assignments**_

**Students will be expected to participate actively in the course
"conversation." This means active class participation, performance of original
library and Internet research, presentation of information on class topics.
Some formal assignments will be conducted in teams; some individually.**

**There will be three major course assignments:**

  * **(30%) development/presentation of team-based research on a specific course topic (teams identified jointly by the instructor and students)**. **DUE AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING COURSE.** **[Click here](disted.html)for required form to submit research citations to whole class. [Click here](distedtopic.html) for research topic suggestions.**  

  * **(60%) development of a program proposal related to a known institutional need (where you work or in a setting known to you). Click here for a more detailed account of this assignment.** **DUE MONDAY, AUGUST 4, 1997.**   **[Click here](distedfinal.html) for detailed final assignment guidelines.** 

**Remaining 10% of grade awarded for class participation and timely, error-
free submission of assigned work.**

* * *

**_Grading Procedures_ **

**Graduate School policy requires all College of Education courses to be
graded. Grades will be awarded according to the general policies of the
College and the University. The following general criteria will apply:**

  * **Passing grades are awarded if the course requirements are adequately fulfilled within the time frames stipulated in the syllabus: A (4), AB (3.5), B (3), BC (2.5), or C (2).**
  * **An "A" grade is reserved for exceptional work not only in completing all formal assignments, but also including unusual initiative and effective class leadership.**
  * **A "B" grade is awarded for solid performance in exams and in the preparation of written assignments and formal seminar presentations. Written assignments should show evidence of independent thought based significantly on the examination of course materials, appropriate reading and pertinent research. Written assignments should be presented in a neat, professional format. Active, constructive class participation will be considered in grading.**
  * **Assignments falling below this standard, but nonetheless meeting minimum course standards, will earn a "C" grade.**
  * **Failure to complete seminar requirements within specified time frames may result in an "incomplete" or a "pr" in unusual circumstances or in cases of documented personal emergency. "Incomplete" and "pr" grades must be converted to a regular letter grade within a time frame negotiated with the instructor (in no case later then the end of the following semester). Except in such circumstances, no passing grade can be awarded when the basic class assignments are not completed on time.** 

**More specifically, students are expected to complete all required
assignments on schedule, and to participate actively in class, on the
Internet, and on the supporting local networks. The following elements will be
factored into grading decisions:**

  * **observance of substantive/technical assignment requirements are followed**
  * **evidence of clear, fair, and consistent  contribution to collaborative student work ( _the instructor will make a value judgment_ )**
  * **support of project and written assignments by research/literature citations befitting graduate-level work (Internet and non-Internet research is expected)**
  * **papers are thorough checking of for typography, spelling, syntax, grammar and pagination**
  * **observance of[APA guidelines](http://www.gasou.edu/psychweb/tipsheet/apacrib.htm) for research writing**
  * **logical and helpful integration  of electronic documentation and in-class presentation with written work**

_**Getting an ACC Account**_

**Every student must have an account either on the UML's Academic Computer
Center (ACC) system or on another Internet service provider (e.g., AOL, TIAC,
Ultranet). Your account, and interactive tools on this syllabus, will be used
to communicate information germane to this course. Your account may be
accessed from outside the UMass Lowell campus from any computer equipped with
a modem and telecommunications software. From home or school, many users will
be able to telephone into the UMass Lowell ACC system without paying a long-
distance toll charge (see Lowell phone number appear at top of syllabus).**

**REQUIRED TEXT:      Johnson, Deborah G., Computer Ethics, Third Ed.,
Prentice Hall, 2001.**

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
**Legal, social, and ethical issues surrounding software development and
computer use. Professional conduct, social responsibility and rigorous
standards for software testing and reliability will be stressed. Issues such
as liability, intellectual property rights, privacy, security, and crime will
be examined in the context of computer use. Students will read, write, discuss
and present reports on these topics. There are no prerequisites for this
course. However, students are expected to be able to do research on the
Internet.**

**GRADING POLICY**  
**    1\. [Ethical Decisions Paper (3-5 pages)
(20%)](http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~tmaddox/cs105/ethics_essay.html)**  
**    2\. [Research
Paper](http://cs.gmu.edu/~tmaddox/cs105/res_paper_inst.html) (30%)**  
**    3\. Instructor Evaluation (including homework, in-class assignments, pop
quizzes, etc.) (20%)**  
**    4\. Final Exam (30%)**

**Instructor evaluation criteria may vary from section to section, and may
include grading for class participation.   Any questions regarding due dates
and specific requirements for your section should be addressed directly to
your individual instructor.  To assist your instructor in responding promptly
to emailed questions, please indicate your full name, class section and reason
for your message __ in the _subject_ line of your email (e.g. _Smith, Bob / CS
105-005 / Homework #1_ ).**

**Due to the short nature of this class, late work creates grading
difficulties and may either be penalized or not accepted, depending upon your
instructor's policy.   Homework assignments will either be presented in class
or placed on your instructor's individual web site.   You will receive details
from your instructor regarding the two major written assignments (Ethics Essay
and Research Paper/Project) -- specific requirements and topics for these
assignments may also vary from section to section.**

**This class relies strongly on class participation.   Therefore, it is
important that you attend class on a regular basis.  While you are welcome to
attend an alternate lecture session if you miss your own, please note that you
may *not* rely on different sections to present the same materials, and you
may not assume that a paper topic accepted by one instructor will be
acceptable by another.  Unless you obtain permission from your own instructor
in advance, you also may not receive credit for class participation or other
in-class activities by attending a section other than your own.**

**** Class papers and homework are to be _individual_ efforts.   Certain
portions of group assignments may require individual efforts as well. Be
careful to follow instructions regarding acceptable group efforts. Plagiarism
is governed by the GMU Honor Code and will not be tolerated.  Instances of
cheating will be referred to the Honor Committee.**

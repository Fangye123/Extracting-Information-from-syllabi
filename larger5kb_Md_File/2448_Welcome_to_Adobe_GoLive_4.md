The Internet. Each student should have a George Mason e-mail account. You will

Course Requirements:  
  
This course is an introduction to the methods, materials, and practices of
research. Each student will shape his or her project within the framework of
our discussion of narrative, memory and evidence, and, in the process, become
acquainted with the resources not only of the university's library but also of
other collections.  
  
This course culminates in a research paper, and there will be a series of
varied lectures, discussion, and exercises to guide you through the process.
To receive a passing grade you must complete ALL assignments. Please keep your
graded work for inclusion in a portfolio at the end of the term. You must
consistently come to class prepared to participate in the discussion, and you
must attend all Friday lectures.  
  
Please note that in-class writing and quizzes may not be made up.  
Late assignments will be marked 1/2 grade down for each day late.  
  
  
Assignments and Percentages:  
  
Museum Assignment = 10%  
Proposal = 10%  
Library Worksheet = 10%  
Web Assignment = 10%  
  
  
Quizzes/Short Writing Assignments/Townhall = 20%  
Draft of Research Paper = 15%  
Final Version of Research Paper = 25%  
  
Keep in mind that good research and writing require determination, creativity,
and open-mindedness. In order to get the most from this class, you need to be
willing to engage in a process of intellectual discovery that is not always
direct, and sometimes downright frustrating. Persevere.  
  
Friday Lectures: In addition to regular in-class assignments, students will be
required to participate in (and sometimes write responses to) Friday lectures.  
  
Students will also be required to attend a performance of The Memorandum
(Theatre of the First Amendment). I encourage you to see a performance before
Prof. Davis's lecture on September 17. You will get information about tickets
at the end of the first week of classes.  
  
Please note that students will be expected to participate in tutorials and
workshops focused on writing and on library and computer research skills.  
  
When writing your papers and doing research, please remember that plagiarism
is a violation of the GMU Honor Code. Plagiarism means using words, opinions,
or factual information from another person without giving that person credit.
Writers give credit through accepted documentation styles, such a
parenthetical citation; a simple listing of books and articles consulted is
not sufficient. Plagiarism is the equivalent of intellectual robbery and
cannot be tolerated in an academic setting. (Adapted from English Department
statement on plagiarism)  
  
All writing assignments done outside of class should be typed and double-
spaced. Be sure to use a standard font, a dark printer ribbon, and to leave
regular (1 inch) margins.  
  
Honors courses meet writing-across-the curriculum requirements for 6-credits
of composition.  
  
Syllabus and assignments: Assignments are wither underlined or in bold on the
syllabus and a short list of due dates is provided at the end of this
syllabus. Because we live in an imperfect world, some assignments may be
revised.

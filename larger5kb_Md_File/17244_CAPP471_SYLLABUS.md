**Course Description:**

The course concentrates on the theory and practice of computer ethics. The aim
of the course is to study the basis for ethical decision-making and the
methodology for reaching ethical decisions concerning computing matters.
Topics studied in the course appear in the outline below. Methodologies used
in the course include lectures by the professor, lectures by visiting
lecturers, in-class discussions, surveys and quizzes, individual class
presentations, case analyses, and examinations. The course is open only to
Notre Dame students at the Senior level who have a second major in Computer
Applications.

**Classroom & Time:**

DeBartolo Hall 242; Tuesday & Thursday, 12:30 - 1:45 p.m.

[Seating chart](seating471)

**Professor:**

[Robert N. Barger, Ph.D.](/~rbarger), Associate Professor, University of Notre
Dame, and Professor Emeritus, Eastern Illinois University. E-mail:
rbarger@NOSPAMnd.edu Note: When using any of the e-mail addresses in this
syllabus, remove the word "NOSPAM" from the address (it is included in this
syllabus to prevent spam robots from collecting usable addresses over the
Web). Phone: (219) 289-8939, Fax: (219) 289-2039. Note: Dr. Barger is
infrequently in the CAPP office and works primarily at home, where he welcomes
contact from students by phone or e-mail.

**Computer Assistance:**

Help Desk, Room 111 Computing/Math Bldg., (219) 631-8111, info.1@nd.edu

**Course requirements, Grade weightings, & Grade scale:**

  1. _"Class Participation" (40% of grade)_ :   
Included in this factor will be completion of in-class writing assignments,
quizzes, and surveys. Note that the in-class activities listed in the calendar
below are subject to change during the semester.

  2. _"Ethics Case Analysis" (10% of grade)_   
Each student will write an analysis of one of the [ computer-related ethics
cases to be found in this link ](cases.html). Use the [Ethics
Worksheet](ethicswork.html) as a format for this case analysis. The analysis
is to be turned in at the **February 26** class meeting. A two point penalty
will apply for each day or partial day that the analysis is late in being
submitted. Criteria which will be used by Dr. Barger in evaluating analyses
are: correctness, completeness, and quality of argument in answering the
worksheet questions; and quality of the grammatical and stylistic composition
of the analysis.

  3. _"Class Presentation" (10% of grade)_ :   
Each student will be assigned to make a fifteen minute power-point
presentation on a topic which _concerns computer ethics_. Allow fifteen
minutes (maximum length) for presentation and five minutes for answering
questions. Notify Dr. Barger by e-mail of your choice for date of presentation
(see class meetings below titled "CLASS PRESENTATIONS") and topic [from the
topics listed on this link](topics.html) by **Feb. 1**. Dr. Barger will assign
the remaining dates and topics after Feb. 1. Students' name, date, and topic
will be posted on the list of [topics](topics.html) as the topic choices are
received by Dr. Barger, so check that list to see if your chosen topic is
still available before e-mailing Dr. Barger. Evaluation will be based on the
quality of the presentation, the quality of responses to questions from the
class arising from the presentation (or, if there are no questions from the
class, the quality of question(s) asked of the class by the speaker), and the
observance of the time allotment. _Note: A printed copy of the presentation
must be handed to Dr. Barger _before_ the presentation commences (this copy
must include at least one question to be asked of the class)_.  
Observe these guidelines for your class presentation:  
a. Follow the order listed in the list of presenters.  
b. The first presenter should be at the podium and should begin the
presentation promptly at 12:30 without waiting for a cue to begin.  
c. Each speaker should hand Dr. Barger a copy of her/his presentation
(including a question or questions that the speaker might ask the class)
before the speaker begins the presentation.  
d. Subsequent speakers should follow their predecessors immediately without
waiting to be called.  
e. Observe the time allowance of fifteen minutes for initial presentation and
an additional five minutes for questions. After fifteen minutes _stop_ and ask
for questions. If there are no questions, have a question prepared to ask the
class. You will find that time during the presentation moves faster than you
would think, so rehearse well since observance of time allotment will be a
factor in your evaluation.  
f. In preparing your Power Point presentation, save your program to a floppy
disk and run it from the A: drive ( **not** the zip drive) on the DeBartolo
classroom PC computer so that you do not have to waste time logging in and
going to your afs space to get it.

NetPros)](lapp.ppt)

  4. _"Examinations" (20% x 2 = 40% of grade)_ :   
The midterm ( **March 7** ) and final ( **May 2** ) examinations will deal
with Computer Ethics topics. They will be in essay style.

  5. _"Excuse Policy for Classes and Exams"_ :   
Students who are absent from a scheduled class will be permitted to make up
the in-class assignment, presentation, or exam within a week of the absence
only if they take the initiative of giving to the professor suitable written
documentation of a sufficient reason for the absence (e.g., Health Service
notice of visit for the date of absence, letter of invitation to a job
interview for the date of absence, obituary for a relative's funeral for the
date of absence).  

  6. _"Policy on extra work"_ : Students should understand at the outset of the course that the above evaluation standards will be strictly applied and that no "extra work" opportunities will be available. 

  7. _"Grade scale"_ : A=100-96, A-=95-90, B+=89-87, B=86-84, B-= 83-80, C+=79-77, C=76-74, C-73-70, D=69-60, F=59-0

Should the rich have a right to the more expensive things because they can afford them, or is the computer such a basic tool that it is wrong for the poor not to have equal access to it?

**_Introduction:**_

**Course Description:**

This course is an introduction to the _comparative_ political _science_ of
capitalist democracies. Our goal is to elucidate a set of systematic
relationships which may exist between certain socio-politico-economic
_variables_ in such countries, not to detail the political _history_ of
capitalist democracies much less of any subset thereof. For example, we are
interested in why different electoral systems might produce different party
systems not in whether Labour won the last British election or by how much
_per se_. The _Labour_ victory is an example of a _datum_ which, combined with
(preferably lots of) other data, will help us to evaluate the empirical
validity of our theories about the relationships between variables.

We define our universe of cases, _capitalist democracies_ , as those countries
in which relatively liberal democracy and relatively free-market capitalism
are no longer a matter of any serious debate but rather serve as the systemic
bounds within which politics is conducted. Empirically, _capitalist
democracies_ corresponds least ambiguously to the countries of North America,
Western Europe, Australasia, and Japan, and so these countries will serve as
our empirical referent. These 24¡À countries are our _cases_ ; that is, each
country-time serves as an example of a political system with certain features.
Comparing across as many of these country-times as possible, we hope to
develop an understanding of the systematic relationships between socio-
politico-economic variables.

**Example:**

So that we are all on the same page regarding the aims of our study, let me
offer an initial simple example of a theorized relationship between variables
and of how we use our 24¡À countries as comparative empirical referents to
evaluate a hypothesis. _Theory_ : plurality/majority (P/M) electoral-systems
are associated with fewer parties than proportional-representation (PR)
electoral-systems. _Variables_ : electoral system, number of parties. _Data_ :
in 24 capitalist democracies, electoral system is coded as either P/M or PR
(PR defined as cases where the number of legislative seats is greater than the
number of electoral districts, P/M by cases where the numbers of seats and
districts are equal), number of parties is coded as either 4 or less or 5 or
more (only parties winning seats in the lower house of the legislature are
counted). Data are for the last election prior to 1990. _Comparative evidence_
: 4 of 6 countries with P/M electoral systems elected four or fewer parties to
the legislature in the last election prior to 1990 whereas 15 of 18 countries
with PR systems elected five or more parties. Seems there may be some validity
to our theory. These are the sorts of questions we will ask; the follow up, of
course, is "So what?" We are also interested after this sort of thing in
whether legislatures with many parties exhibit systematic differences in the
sorts of legislation they produce from legislatures with fewer parties. Do
multipolar legislatures act slower than bipolar legislatures, perhaps? Are the
latter prone to more extremism? _etc._

or More Parties in Legislature

**_Course Requirements and Grading:_**

**Required Texts:**

The following texts provide the core of our readings and may be purchased at
Shaman Drum. They are also on reserve at the _UgLi_ , but you will find it
much more convenient to have your own copies.

Parties in Advanced Western Democracies_ , 2nd ed., (Chatham House: 1996).  
2\. Laver, Michael and Kenneth Shepsle, _Making and Breaking Governments:
Cabinets and Legislatures in Parliamentary Democracies_ (Cambridge UP: 1996).  
3\. Leduc, Lawrence, Richard G. Niemi, Pippa Norris, _Comparing Democracies:
Elections and Voting in Global Perspective_ (Sage: 1996).  
4\. Lijphart, Arend, _Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-
Seven Democracies, 1945-1990_ (Oxford UP: 1994).  
5\. Powell, G. Bingham, Jr., _Contemporary Democracies: Participation,
Stability, and Violence_ (Harvard UP 1982).  
_Recommended:_

Government in Modern Europe_ , 2nd ed. (McGraw-Hill: 1995).  
7\. Lane, Jan-Erik, and Svante O. Ersson, _Politics and Society in Western
Europe_ , 3rd ed. (Sage:1994).  
(The former is recommended only because of its exorbitant price; we read about
half of it. The latter is recommended only because I am in the process of
easing it out of the course; we will probably not read all the sections of it
indicated below.)

**Assignments:**

**Reading and Class Participation:**

Everyone is responsible for being prepared with all of each week's readings
when you come to class. Class meetings will only partly be lecture as I am
endeavoring to make this learning experience an interactive one (as much as
course size permits). Your cooperation in that endeavor by participating in
discussion, providing comments and criticism when asked, and asking questions
as you have them is crucial (and will be part of your grade). If class size is
too large for free discussion, I will direct it: expect to be called upon.

**_Resident Experts_ and Short Papers:**

In our first meeting, the class will be divided into 5 or 6 groups. Every week
throughout the middle of the course, one group will serve as our _resident
experts_ on that week's materials. We rotate through the groups twice. This is
_NOT_ a "group assignment"; each _resident expert_ is on her/his own for all
aspects of the assignment and will be graded individually.

Each _resident expert_ must write a _short_ paper _critically_ reviewing or
_empirically_ considering that week's material. A critical review does not
merely summarize the readings; it offers intelligent argumentation as to why
some of the reviewed argument(s) may not be quite right, or further reasons
that they may be, and/or suggestions as to what is instead or also true,
and/or some other further implications the author has not considered, _etc._
An empirical consideration does not merely summarize the readings; it attempts
to apply the argument empirically to some country or countries. That is, try
to sketch how the author's argument might work in some country or countries
outside of the original sample or otherwise go beyond the original empirical
application. Do not simply replicate the author's own empirics. These papers
are to be _brief_ (shoot for 5 double-spaced, 12-point-font, 1"-margins-all-
around pages), so you do not need to develop your critiques or your empirics
at any length. Think of the papers as intellectual reactions to the readings;
try to raise provoking food for thought for class discussion. Your paper may
in fact serve as a basis for class discussion.

_Resident experts_ will be held especially responsible for rescuing class
discussion if it gets bogged down (or fails to get started). Recall that such
participation is being graded for everyone; it is doubly important for
_resident experts_.

We will rotate through the groups so that each student is a _resident expert_
twice. Try to write one paper of each type for your own edification, but I
will not hold anyone to that.

**Final Exam:**

There will be a final cumulative exam on a day and time during exam period to
be determined by the university.

**Grading:**

General Preparedness and Participation: 15%¡À ; Resident Expert Duties and
Short Papers: 50%¡À (25%¡À each) ; Final Exam: 35%¡À.

**Due Dates:**

_Readings_ should be completed before class.

Two copies of your _Short Papers_ , one for me and one for your GSI, should be
delivered to your GSI in a manner to be determined by her/him no later than
the Monday (5pm) _prior_ to that week's classes.

_The Final Exam_ will be during examination period.

#### Course Description:

Most leading thinkers of the 20th century, and even many popular intellectuals
of the late 20th century (Derrida and Foucault to name the two most
influential), have agreed that the foundations of many major facets of modern
life were laid in ancient Greece and Rome. In the field of politics,
representational government originated in Greece and developed into republican
institutions in Rome. Intellectually the ancient mediterranean gave us almost
every field we recognize today from literature to philosophy, natural science
to communications. In Religion Greece left a rich tradition of pagan cults
(many enjoying a revival today), and the Roman world brought us the two most
influential religions of the modern world, Christianity and Islam. This course
will attempt to understand some of the complex forces that shaped ancient
culture. But rather than inspecting wars, political maneuvers, philosophical
subtleties, literary artifice, or artistic achievement, we will ponder the
values of ancient Greeks and Romans, how they were formed, and how in turn
they helped form the many institutions still familiar to us today.

This course has been selected to represent historical analysis in our core
curriculum, and thus will pay close attention to the workings of history.
Traditionally Greek and Roman history are broken down into four main periods:
the rather complicated early culture that we will inspect in Hesiod's poetry;
the late period of the Greek city-states ( _poleis_ ) or the Classical Period
within a hundred years of consolidation by the Hellenistic warlords; the
period of Roman ascendancy throughout the world spanning from the mid-first
century B.C. to the late first century A.D.; and the late Roman (Christian)
period from the third and fourth centuries A.D. We will work through these
four periods chronologicaly as we discuss a variety of ancient values from the
central issues surrounding war, rhetoric, the gods, and law to mass culture,
sexuality, and whatever else interests the class. We will see some stunning
changes throughout our periods, as well as some unexpected continuity,
probably with many of us disagreeing with each other as we go. Such
disagreement will lead to a more stimulating experience of history, and
perhaps to a more sensitive understanding of our own values.

#### Course Requirements

This course is intended to stimulate thought, and thus the first and most
difficult requirement is to think. This thinking will best be directed towards
the readings so students will be expected to read carefully all of the
selections and be prepared to discuss them in class. The discussion will be
organized in the following way: each student will present one of the readings
by publishing an argument on its significance to Greek and Roman values one
class before we do the reading; all students will also be expected to both
criticize and support the points of other speakers. Each student will edit her
argument taking into account the class discussion, and turn this in as her
paper (10 pages, double-spaced, 12 point font, 1 inch margins) for the course.
There will also be two tests given in order to help inspire more careful and
punctual reading, as well as in order to synthesize the material of the
course.

#### Grading

  * Class Participation 20 % 
  * Class Presentation 15 % 
  * Paper 25 % [DUE December 7, 5 PM] 
  * Midterm 20 % 
  * Final 20 % 
  * Assessment Criteria

Presentations, papers, and midterm/final essays will be assessed according to
the following criteria. These are listed in hierarchical order though all
criteria are almost equal in importance. It is of particular importance to
remember that this course focuses on historical analysis. We are not trying
just to amass evidence or just to rehearse standard historical judgments.
Rather we are concentrating closely on the values and attitudes of Greek and
Roman people, how they were formed, and how they changed over time. So above
all students should concentrate on analyzing the evidence gleaned from our
course materials.

1) evidence of serious thought on their chosen argument/problem  
2) clarity of proposed argument/analysis/system  
2) command of the appropriate reading (or whatever evidence is applied)  
3) ability to draw in other sources to the discussion  
4) command of general history surrounding the specific problem  
5) familiarity with the class discussion  
6) persuasiveness of argument  
7) synthesis of specific problem into the broader issues of Greek and Roman
values  
8) originality or at least attempted originality

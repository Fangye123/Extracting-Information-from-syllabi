#  Physics 382 - Acoustics I: Sounds and Sources

This document is the de facto syllabus for the course.  You may be quizzed on
this information... ;)

The most recent update of this material was on 4 September 2002.

    
**Text:** We'll be using the debut edition of Dr. Russell's intermediate-level
text.  
This book is written for more depth than a descriptive liberal arts course,
and less mathematical complexity than the standard texts in acoustics (usually
graduate-level). Click to jump to a list of documented errors in version 1.0

###  Description

The course is a survey of the study of acoustics, with fundamentals concepts
and principles at the heart of sound and vibration.  
Students in Acoustics I may adopt these goals:

Know principles and terms of oscillation and wave phenomena;  
Apply these principles to model acoustic systems simply;  
Analyze sounds to describe them in standard and accepted ways;  
Connect these methods of describing sound to the human sense of hearing;  
Describe transmission of sound in air;  
Describe simple sources of airborne sound;  
Describe transmission of sound in enclosures.

The content of this course wraps around in a spiral fashion:

We'll touch on topics in one area, circle around to another area, and another
area, and so on...

###  Evaluation and Grading

The final grade will be calculated based on the following components:

     Homework 60%
     Midterm Exam 15%
     Final Exam 25%
_Homework_. Weekly problem sets will be assigned.   Do these habitually and
honestly.  Group study is encouraged, but as in any team situation, you'll
learn best by active and thoughtful participation.  Turn in work that reflects
your own understanding.  Show your work, explain your claims, and turn in
computer code (including Matlab, Maple, etc.)  Homework that is late by more
than one week is not accepted.

_Midterm Exam_   This is a take-home test that will be given after Week 5.  It
is due Thursday of Week 6.

* * *

_Modification:  _ The take-home exercise will be solely for your preparation.
The midterm exam will be taken in class on Thursday of week 6, 22 August 2002,
the next full moon.  We will spend 30 minutes during class on the test, with
open-book, open-notes conditions.  The test will be based on the take-home
exercise, with adaptations:

  * numbers will be changed, and
  * questions will be asked differently

Therefore, know the material thoroughly by working through the take-home
exercise.  You may help each other, and you are encouraged to use all
resources available. _Understand the physics_ rather than the particular
problem!

_Follow-up_ :  To receive a scaled score which correlates to the Kettering
grading system, please

  1. Review the in-class midterm, and more fully understand the physics surrounding each question.
  2. Schedule and keep an appointment with me (the instructor) for a 15-minute interview.
  3. Demonstrate your understanding of the course content to me during that interview.

* * *

_Final Exam_. The final exam will be given at the determined final exam time,
and will cover the salient material from the entire course. This is intended
to be an opportunity for you to pause and synthesize ideas.

  

_Extra Credit_ Near the end of the term, you will have the opportunity to
improve your score by completing an extra credit assignment. It is intended
for you to investigate and/or share a narrow topic with more depth. [ An
accompanying page](http://www.kettering.edu/%7Edludwigs/ECAcI.html) will
detail the assignment.

  

* * *

###  Policies and Procedures

Motivated by the goals and objectives of the course, these policies and
procedures are intended to foster a **safe and constructive environment for
learning** physics. To maintain this kind of environment, the instructor
reserves the right to take any reasonable action sanctioned by University
policy, including but not limited to failure on an assignment or withdrawal of
student from the course. Disruptive behavior (including excessive talking),
ethnic or racial discrimination, or sexual harassment will not be tolerated.
**Please turn off cell phones and pagers.**

_Academic Integrity_. I expect the highest level of academic integrity from
students. The exams are designed to reflect individual performance, and are
not collaborative efforts. Plagiarism (the use of another's ideas as your own)
is not acceptable. Evidence of cheating, or anything contradicting these
policies, may result in a score of zero on the assignment or other action at
my discretion. Please know and practice the Kettering University Code of
Academic Integrity, found on page 40 of the student handbook.

_Office Hours_. I will be in my office at the above scheduled times, except
under extreme circumstances. However, please feel free to visit me in my
office whenever my door is open. A third alternative is a prearranged meeting
set up in class, via email, or by calling my office.

> _Regular and prompt attendance and active class participation are so
important to this course that if you miss more than two class periods, I
reserve the right to withdraw you from the class roll._

_Evaluation_. Grading will emphasize understanding. Therefore, the process of
solution may often be awarded partial and significant credit, and minutiae
such as arithmetic errors carry less weight in scoring. Again, practice on
homework problems will help establish habits that will score higher: solutions
must demonstrate clear thinking. Appeals are welcome if you feel that a quiz,
test, or exam has not been graded fairly. Extra credit may be awarded if you
discover a significant error on a section test, midterm, or final exam.
Prepare your argument in writing, either by prose explanation or clearly-
worked solution, then visit me personally.

_Extra Credit from reviewing the text._   If your [ emailed
report](mailto:dludwigs@kettering.edu) is the first to point out an error in
Russell's text, you'll receive extra credit toward your homework score.  I'll
add the error to this list.  Five points will be awarded for a significant
problem with the content, such as incorrect algebra or an erroneous statement.
Two points will be awarded for a typographical error that clouds the meaning
of the passage, and one point for a typographical error that is
inconsequential or obviously a typo.  I retain the right to be the sole judge
of how many points are awarded.  Only the first one to find and report an
error receives points.

Here are the known errors thus far:

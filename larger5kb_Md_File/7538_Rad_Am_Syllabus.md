**Class paper:**  Every member of the seminar who hasn't already completed
this  
assignment will present a short paper (5-6 pages) on a book related to seminar  
readings. See the class schedule for specific assignments.  Books assigned for  
class papers and presentations are on reserve at the library, and most are
also  
available at the bookstore.

**Course journal:** For each reading assignment, write a one-page essay that
addresses  
the journal question(s) for that assignment and supports your response with
evidence  
from the text(s). Journals will be collected on February 22, March 15, and May
17.

**Website (www.slc.edu/~pmurolo/radhist):** Visit the site to review the
syllabus,  
read class papers, and find links of interest to radical historians and
activists.

**Assessments of conference work:**  Our readings for January 29 through
February 8  
are the conference papers' first drafts. Copies will be available in the
library, in the  
"Murolo" box on the open shelves next to the reserve collection.  DO NOT
REMOVE  
THE PAPERS FROM THE LIBRARY; PHOTOCOPY THOSE YOU WISH TO READ AT HOME.  
We'll discuss each draft for about 30 minutes, starting with the author's
evaluation  
of her/his work thus far.  Students must write a short assessment of each
classmate's  
work-in-progress--its main strengths, main weaknesses, and possibilities for
further  
development. Comments are due when the work is discussed in class. Please hand  
in two copies.

**Conference report:**  On Friday and Saturday, March 1 and 2, Sarah Lawrence
will host  
a conference on youth activism, past and present.  Members of this seminar are
expected  
to attend as much of the conference as possible and to write 4-5 pages on what
they  
learn there.  The reports should be included in the course journal (March 15
installment).  



**  
CONFERENCE WORK**

**Schedule:**  The task this term is to expand, revise and polish projects
begun in the fall.  
Specific assignments are:  
March 1 - updated prospectus and bibliography (See guidelines below.)  
April 12 - brief progress report (what's been done; what's left to do)  
May 3 - final draft of the conference paper (THREE COPIES)  
May 12-17 - small-group discussions of papers

**Small groups:**  During the last week of the term, small groups will meet to
discuss members' final drafts.  
Days and times TBA.  The groups are:  
#1 - Amber Friendly, Lauren Kelly, Sari Rotskoff  
#2 - Marisa Bois, Mark Gunnery, Arlene Schwartz  
#3 - Tori Andrea, Jarrett Farmer, Katie Marcuz  
#4 - Francesca Camillo, Malika Crutchfield, Anna Rankin

**Guidelines for the updated prospectus and bibliography (due March 1)  
**

\- Restate or revise the central question that informs your conference project
and your thesis  
in reply to that question:  What's the main point you wish to make in your
final draft?

\- Comment on the significance of your project:  Why is your topic important,
and what will you  
add to what other people have said about it?

\- Summarize your research agenda for the spring term:  What, exactly, remains
to be done?  
Are there things you need to find out before you can be sure of your central
question, your  
thesis, and why they matter? Does your latest thinking about conceptual and
analytic issues  
require changes in the reading/research plan you mapped out in the fall?  Must
you alter the  
plan on account of logistical problems?  If you must do off-campus research,
what arrangements  
have you made?

\- Include a revised bibliography--not every relevant text you've identified
but only those you'll  
cite or consult as you write the paper's final draft.

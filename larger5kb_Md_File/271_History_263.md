**Course Description** (from the catalog): "A survey of Spanish and Portuguese
America since the wars for independence. Topics include the aftermath of the
independence movements, incorporation into the international economy, changing
social organization, race relations, the search for political stability, the
role of the military, 20th century revolution movements, intellectual and
cultural trends, and the debt crisis."

**Prerequisites:   **History 101 and 102, or 103 and 104.

**Organization, Objectives, and Grading:  
** The organization of this class is based on units, with lectures and
discussion days as outlined below. The requirements do not assume a
familiarity with (or previous coursework in) Latin American history, nor do
they assume a knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese. This is the second half of
an introductory survey of the region.

Course objectives are to: 1.  Introduce students to major economic, political,
and social themes in modern Latin American history;  2.  Increase students'
awareness and appreciation of the rich cultural past of Latin America; 3.
Develop critical skills in reading for content, effective writing, listening,
and speaking;  4.  Promote skills for students to work together in groups;  5.
Encourage additional study of Latin America and the wider globe in additional
courses in History, Political Science, Anthropology, foreign languages and
other areas, especially the minor in Latin American and Caribbean Studies.
While striving towards these five goals, students will be asked to consider
one question, which will tie together much of the course materials:  _How
does_ _one explain the continuing underdevelopment of modern Latin America?_  

Grading will be based on a total of 100 points, distributed as follows:

Scale in percentages:  100-90=A; 89-86=B+; 85-80=B; 79-76=C+; 75-70=C;
69-60=D; less than 60=F. Please note that final  grades for your courses are
announced by the Registrar's Office and are available on Cougar Trail shortly
after the final exam.

**Requirements for Written Work**

All work must be typed and all margins must not exceed one inch (sides, top,
and bottom) and must be written in twelve point type (this is twelve point).
Papers which do not conform to these basic guidelines will be returned to the
student ungraded and without comment. Late papers will be penalized five
points for each day late.

During the course, you will be required to write a one-page paper, which has a
total of one page. It does not have a cover page; it does not have a second
page. Put your name at the top of the page. If you submit more than one page
for such an assignment, it will be returned to you without comment for
rewriting.

Your longer essay for this class can be on virtually any topic you select,
approved in your discussions with me, which focuses on modern Mexico, Central,
or South America (i.e. since 1800). Please note that your topic must be
approved by me and should be eight to ten pages long, typed and double-spaced.
Your draft is due Tuesday April 4 and should be at least six pages long, typed
and double-spaced. The final, edited copy is due on the last day of class, 25
April. you must submit the draft and my sheet of comments with the final copy,
since you are being graded on how much you have improved and expanded your
final essay. If you do not submit your draft, it is impossible to know this.

**Requirements for Oral Presentation**

Each student must join one of the national committees which will orally
present its findings to the class at the end of the semester. The number of
committees will depend on the final course enrollment, but may include:
Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, and
Uruguay. Your committee report should be at least 10, and not longer than 15,
minutes and should address:

  1. The distribution of the population, any major ethnic groups, and major cities;
  2. The nature of the economy;
  3. Physical geography and national infrastructure;
  4. Basic statistics such as life expectancy, health care and related issues; and
  5. The cultural and historical factors which make this country unique.

Presentations will take the last two class sessions. Each individual in the
group will receive the same grade, so you all will need to work together
closely and help each other. Before we reach the end of this class, we will
cover some of the factors which make an effective presentation, but
organization and practice are certainly two keys.

**You will benefit most from the class and avoid a number of potentially
serious problems if you:**

  1. Complete the assigned readings **before** , not after, each lecture.
  2. Keep up with readings--do not allow yourself to fall behind. Reserve a special time in your weekly schedules for the readings.
  3. Borrow notes from a friend in the class in the event you miss a lecture. Please do no come to my office and ask me for a synopsis of a missed lecture. However, you should feel free to come to me to ask questions after you have discussed the missed lecture with another student.
  4. Visit me **during my office hours** to ask any questions you may have. I am happy to meet with you and discuss any issues you might want to raise. That is why I have office hours. If you are unable to see me during my scheduled office hours, ask for an appointment and we can arrange another time. Directly before and after class are the two worst possible times to try to talk with me.
  5. Review this syllabus carefully and note the dates when assignments are due. Reserve a couple of days just for assignments for this class. If you plan your time in this fashion, you will be able to avoid being rushed at the last minute trying to complete the required readings and writing an essay over material which in new. The result will actually be less work completed over a longer period. Your essay will reflect a better understanding of the material. you will also avoid running out of time. I will not accept student comments such as "I did not have enough time to complete the assignment," "It is not my fault that I did not have enough time..." and so on. As of the first day of class, you know exactly what is due and when. Plan for it or accept the consequences.
  6. Submit your own work on time. That may sound easy, but it means **your** work (not something written by someone else) on the date and time due. The first day of class we will review the course requirements and the meaning of the term _plagiarism_. Students guilty of plagiarism will be reported to the honor board of the College and will receive an F for this class. All students are reminded that we are required to follow the honor code of the College. This code is explained in detail in the _Student Handbook_.

This syllabus is the guide to this course. Keep it handy and note the due
dates of assignments. This syllabus also clearly outlines the course
requirements and expectations. **If you feel that the readings are too long or
too hard or the requirements are too demanding, then drop this class.** When
you return on the second day of class, you have agreed to the assignments
outlined in this syllabus.

Students are reminded that eating, drinking, and smoking are prohibited in
classrooms and hallways at the College of Charleston. I will appreciate no
having to ask students a second time to refrain from bringing food or liquids
into the classroom, or from making or receiving telephone calls or being
paged, applying make-up, and other rude, inconsiderate, and distracting
activities during class.

**Attendance Policy**

This course covers a huge geographical area and spans two centuries. Yet, we
only meet twice per week for fourteen weeks. As a result, each of our sessions
is important. **Students will be allowed two unexcused absences**. A third
unexcused absence will result in a grade of F for the course.

From time to time, real emergencies and problems do occur. The College has an
established policy to deal with these. you will need to present written
documentation to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies (e.g. police or medical
reports), who will examine it and inform me when you have an excused absence.
**Please do not call me or the History Department secretaries to say that you
will be absent on a given day**. It is pointless. **Follow the procedure
outlined above** and be aware that more than two unexcused absences will
result in an F. **Students absent on quiz days will not be allowed to make up
the test without a valid, excused absence**.

**Students are responsible for all material, including deadlines and any other
information,** **covered in class, whether they are present or not.**

The following can be purchased in the College of Charleston bookstore on
Calhoun Street or at University Books on King Street. (*=on reserve in the

**MIGRATION**

How has the movement of people to and within North America affected
individuals, societies, and the environment?

**LIBERTY vs. ORDER**

How have Americans attempted to reconcile these goals?

**AMERICAN IDENTITY**

What does it mean to be an American? How were American ideals and institutions
shaped -- for better or worse -- in the years before 1877?

* * *

Welcome to United States History to 1877. As we survey this period in United
States history, we will pay particular attention to the questions above and
how the answers to these questions have changed over time. Along the way, we
will undoubtedly pose additional questions.

**In this class,** we will do some of the things you probably already
associate with the study of history -- we will read a textbook and try to gain
an understanding of key events and trends in American history. However, we
will do many things that may be new to you. We will explore history as a
process of interpretation -- that is, not only as a series of names and dates,
but also as a process of figuring out what those names and dates _mean_. As
often as possible, we will use our class time as a history  "lab" \-- a time
for dissecting documents, examining artifacts, and discussing important ideas.

We live in a time when a vast array of information is available. Increasingly,
that information comes not in neat packages, like textbooks, but is amassed in
archives and databases. One goal of this course is to give you insight into
how historians search out and interpret historical data. This is intended to
help you navigate your own future in the information age.

**This is what you can expect to get out of this class:**

A level of historical literacy that will allow you to make informed choices as
a member of today's society.

Increased skills in posing questions, seeking answers, and interpreting and
communicating your findings.

A chance to relate this course to your own family history, interests, or
career plans.

**_Grades_**

Grades will strictly adhere to Villanova University's grading criteria. As a
reminder, an "A" is defined as:

"the highest academic grade possible; an honor grade which is not
automatically given to a student who ranks highest in the course, but is
reserved for accomplishment that is truly distinctive and demonstrably
outstanding. It represents a superior mastery of course material and is a
grade that demands a very high degree of understanding as well as originality
or creativity as appropriate to the nature of the course. The grade indicates
that the student works independently with unusual effectiveness and often
takes the initiative in seeking new knowledge outside the formal confines of
the course."

For other grade criteria, consult the University Catalog, pp. 34-35.

**PROFESSOR'S DRACONIAN POLICIES** **Attendance** | **To be successful in this
course, you must attend regularly.** We will often spend our class time
discussing documents, an experience that cannot be duplicated by getting
someone's notes. If you miss class, you will forfeit credit for any informal
writing assignments that are completed in class that day (see p. 3).  

**Also note: For freshmen, attendance is required.**  
---|---  
**Preparation** | **Thorough preparation is expected.** Unless otherwise
noted, reading assignments must be completed by Monday of the week they are
assigned. If you come to class obviously unprepared, you will be invited to
spend the class time elsewhere catching up. Quizzes may be added if lack of
preparation is widespread.  
**Deadlines** | **LATE PAPERS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.** This applies to informal
reading assignments as well as papers. Exceptions will be made only in cases
of unanticipated, unavoidable, _documented_ emergency.  
**Where to turn things in** | **Bring your work to class.** _DO NOT_ slide
papers under office doors or leave them in the History Department. If you must
miss class on a day when an assignment is due, you may fax it to: (215)
925-6919. The fax must be received the same day as the class meeting.  
**How to contact the professor** | _Office hours:_ St. Augustine Center,
Mondays and Wednesdays,  

2-3:30 p.m., and other times by appointment. Please don't hesitate to ask.

_Best method otherwise:_ E-mail to cmires@email.vill.edu.  

_Office phone / voice mail:_ 519-6935.  
    
    


**INFORMAL WRITING ASSIGNMENTS**

Throughout the semester, you will be asked to do a series of short, informal
writing assignments. These assignments are intended to develop skills that
will help you succeed on the exams for this course. Some of the assignments
are noted on the syllabus. Others may be added, and we will probably do some
additional informal writing in class as we analyze historical documents.
(NOTE: In order to do the in-class assignments, which will not be announced in
advance, you must be in class. You cannot make up these assignments later.)

These assignments may be hand-written if your writing is legible. Otherwise,
please type.

The individual assignments will not receive letter grades; at the end of the
semester, an overall grade will be assigned based on your diligence and
thoughtfulness in completing these assignments. The informal writing
assignments are required. If you skip more than two of them, your grade for
this part of the course will drop _precipitously_. And, since these
assignments are designed to prepare you for exams, skipping them is also
likely to affect your exam grades.

* * *

**PAPERS**

The papers in this class are intended to encourage you to pursue your own
interests and to introduce you to ways that you may explore history beyond the
classroom.

For one 3-5 page paper, you will review a book of your choice. The book must
meet the following criteria: It must be non-fiction; deal with some aspect of
the United States before 1877; have footnotes or endnotes; and be at least 150
pages long. You cannot use a book that you have read before or a book that you
are reading for another class. Please do not choose autobiographies or
published diaries for this assignment.

The other 3-5 page paper will be based on a visit to a museum or historic site
or participation in a historical tour. A list of possibilities will be
provided.

Detailed instructions for these assignments will be provided in a separate
handout. One paper is due Oct. 24 and the other is due Nov. 25\. You may
choose which paper to do first.

* * *

EXAMS

The course is divided into three units, with an exam for each. Each exam will
have two parts:

Short-answer questions that assess your historical literacy. The class will
participate in deciding which historical "facts" are the most important to
know and, therefore, should be included in this part of the exam.

Essay(s) that assess your historical interpretation skills. For example, the
essay for the first unit will ask you to analyze a historical document, using
the skills we have worked on in class. You will be given at least part of the
question(s) in advance of each exam, and you will be allowed to prepare and
use a limited amount of notes (such as an outline).

On the final exam, the essay portion will be cumulative, but the short-answer
section will cover Unit 3 only.

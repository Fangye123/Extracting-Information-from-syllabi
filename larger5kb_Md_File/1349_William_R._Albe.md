                         6.  UNITS OF DISTANCE MEASUREMENT
    
    * Light Year (LY)
    	- DISTANCE that light travels in 1 year
    	- speed of light 	= 186,000 miles per second
    			        = 300,000,000 meters per second
    			        = 5,800,000,000,000 miles (5.8 trillion)
    
    * Astronomical Unit (AU)
    	- distance between Earth and Sun 	= 93,000,000 miles
    						= 8.4 light minutes
    * parsec (pc)
    	- distance of object that would have stellar parallax of one arc second
     	- 1 pc = 3.26 LY
    
    * POWERS OF TEN (orders of magnitude, "scientific notation")
    	- used for very large or very small numbers
    	- number between 1 and 10 multiplied by 10 raised to a positive or negative 
              integer
    	- examples:
    
    		10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000 = 1 x 104 (or E04, 10^4, 10**4)
    
    		1/10 x 1/10 x 1/10 = 1/1000 = 1 x 10-3
    
    * To Read a power of 10: move decimal point same number of places as power of ten; 	
      to the right if positive, to the left if negative
    	- examples:
    
    		circumference of Earth:  2.5 x 104 miles = 25,000 miles
    
    		distance to moon:	2.4 x 105 = 240,000 miles
    
    * To Make a power of 10:
    	- place a new decimal point after the "first significant digit" (left-most 
              non-zero digit). Count from the new to the original decimal points.
    
    	- The power of 10 is the number of digits, positive if counting to the 
              right, negative if counting to the left.
    
    	- examples:
    
    	      Light Year distance: 5,800,000,000,000 = 5.8 x 1012 miles
    			 	 ("5" is the first significant digit)
    
    	      time needed for light to travel 1 meter:
    
    	           1 second / 300,000,000 meters = 0.000,000,003,3 sec/meter
    
    	           0.000,000,0033 = 3.3 x 10-9 seconds per meter

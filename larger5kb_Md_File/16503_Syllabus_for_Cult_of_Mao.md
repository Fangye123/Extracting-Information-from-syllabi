History 110

## THE MAO CULT

     The Great Helmsman of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, is one of the most controversial figures in history. Did he save China or almost destroy it? Should he be revered as a hero or defiled as a demon? In China of the 1990s, an entire cult has sprung up around Mao Zedong-perhaps not as all-encompassing as the Mao Worship of the 1960s and early 1970s, but still an intriguing and important phenomenon. Against a background of contemporary Chinese history (represented by the Meisner readings), this course will look at the personal and public history of the Chairman and the cults he continues to inspire. We will also explore personality cults in comparative perspective and look at Mao Zedong's impact in other parts of the world. In addition, we will talk about what makes a leader a leader, and how "followers" are made. This class is geared towards developing critical reading, writing, and research skills; it will be intensely participatory.

### READING ASSIGNMENTS

     The following books are available at Water Street Bookstore. In addition, you should purchase a packet of readings from the History Department Office (Stetson 310). Readings in the xeroxed course packet are marked with an asterisk (*). **PACKET ORDER IS NOT NECESSARILY SYLLABUS ORDER.** Required readings and supplementary materials are also available through 24-hour loan in the library reserve section.

_Required_ :

Meisner, Maurice _Mao's China and After_  
Barme, Geremie _Shades of Mao_  
Snow, Edgar _Red Star Over China_  
Gao, Yuan _Born Red_  
Mao, Tse-tung _Quotations of Chairman Mao_

_Optional_ :

Li, Zhisui The Private Life of Chairman Mao

### REQUIREMENTS

     Classes will be discussion sessions, with short lectures provided as background where needed. Films will be an integral part of the course, as we try to capture the intensity of feelings that surrounded Chairman Mao during and after his lifetime. Please complete the assigned readings before each class session and come prepared to share your opinions, observations, and questions. You will be expected to develop a grasp of the key events in recent Chinese history, roughly 1930-1990, while focusing heavily on Mao's role in that history. Students are responsible for all required readings, active discussion, and participation in debates. Grades will be calculated as follows: class participation (includes attendance, active listening, participation in "Mao Zedong Thought Study Sessions", and quality of comments/questions in discussions and debates) (20%); weekly response papers, assorted quizzes, and leadership of a Study Session (20%); one short paper (5-7 pages), peer review, and rewrite (15%+5%+10%); and a final 15-page paper which attempts to answer some aspect of the question "Why the Mao Cult?" (30%).

     Each student will be allowed three "grace days" per semester to hand in late papers. These may be used singularly or in combination, but after the grace days are used up, no late papers will be accepted from that student.

the academic regulations set forth in the Williams College Honor Code and all

## SYLLABUS

This graduate-level colloquium will explore how historians have conceptualized
and interpreted African American urban life. The syllabus offers a sampling of
approaches rather than a comprehensive narrative and readings are organized
topically rather than chronologically. The course aims toward an understanding
of trends in the writing of African-American history, while exploring the
assumptions and logic underlying historical argument, the intellectual and
political implications of particular approaches, and related issues.

Because the course emphasizes reading, the writing assignments will focus on
critical analysis of the readings. Each student will write:

  1. Four short essays - generally of 1-2 pages, double spaced with a font size of 12. The absolute maximum, though neither necessary nor desirable, is three pages. I will not read anything on a fourth page. Each essay will focus on a week's readings (any 4 weeks; take your choice as long as the first paper is submitted by the third week of the quarter). The point of these essays is to think critically about the reading. If more than one reading is assigned, the essay should address them not one by one, but rather thematically. Where a single book is assigned, the essay can read like a book review, albeit one that raises more questions than it answers. The essays should be emailed (attached and pasted in, to eliminate technological glitches) by 11 a.m. on the day the readings will be discussed. I prefer to receive them the night before, since that would provide me with an opportunity to read some of them before our discussion - but preference and practicality do not always align perfectly.
  
  

  2. Two 5-7 page essays due on Monday, May 8, and Monday, June 5 in the History Dept. office (SS330). These essays can focus on any topic related to the course. They should draw only on assigned readings and should integrate readings from at least two (and preferably more) different weeks. Again, double-spaced with a font size of 12.

All articles and excerpts from books (except _Black Metropolis and Race
Rebels_ ) are on 2-hour reserve at Regenstein. _Race Rebels and Black
Metropolis_ , like other assigned books are available for purchase at the
Seminary Coop Bookstore and (except for _Black Metropolis_ ) are on 1-day
reserve. Regenstein has numerous copies of _Black Metropolis_.

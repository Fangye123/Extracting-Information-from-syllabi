###  Office hours:

Office hours are 10:00 to 11:00 on Mondays and 8:30 to 9:30 on Tuesdays and
Thursdays in Holland 604. If these times are not convenient for you, please
call to set up an appointment at another time.  To find Holland 604, take the
stairs from the fifth floor, on the east side of the building (closest to Old
Main), to the sixth floor of Holland Hall.  (This office may not be accessible
to anyone with a handicap.  If that is a problem for you, please let me know
and we can find another place to meet.)

###  Chinese names and romanization

Chinese names and terms present problems for those unfamiliar with them, but
they are unavoidable in a class on Chinese history. Please note that surnames
come before personal names: Wang Yangming, for example, is Mr. Wang, not Mr.
Yangming.  Generally surnames consist of one syllable, and personal names are
two syllables.  Chinese names and terms are spelled in the Roman alphabet
("romanized") according to various systems.  This course will use the pinyin
system, but some of the assigned readings will use the older Wade-Giles
system.  In class discussions, don't worry about pronouncing Chinese and terms
accurately.  This is a history class, not a language class, so just an
approximation of correct pronunciation is fine.

Pinyin is pronounced somewhat the way it looks.  Some exceptions are as
follows:

     g is always hard (as in go, not as in gin)
     q is like ch in church; thus the Qing dynasty is pronounced Ching
     x is like sh in she
     u after q or x is like the umlauted  in German, or ue in French rue
     zh is like j in Joe
     z is like dz
     c is like ts
     i after ch, r, sh, or zh is pronounced urr (shi sounds like the English sure)

Wade-Giles has its own quirks:

     ch sounds like j (ching = first syllable in jingle)
     ch' sounds like ch (ch'in = chin)
     j sounds like r (jen = English rent without the final t)
     k sounds like g (kang = gong)
     k' sounds like k (k'ang = kong in Hong Kong)
     p sounds like b (ping = bing)
     p' sounds like p (p'ao = pow)
     t sounds like d (dan = the English name Don)
     t' sounds like t (t'ou = English toe)
  
  In both systems,

     ao rhymes with cow
     ei rhymes with may
     ou rhymes with Joe

###  Study guide for map quiz

Please be prepared to locate the following places on an outline map.  I have
listed both the pinyin and traditional (Wade-Giles or Post Office) spellings,
and would like you to be able to recognize both.  Pinyin romanizations in
parentheses are generally not used in English (Xianggang for Hong Kong, for
example).

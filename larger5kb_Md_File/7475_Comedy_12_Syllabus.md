DESCRIPTION:

In this course we will focus primarily on writing, specifically on the process
of crafting analytical papers that use the texts that we will read as starting
points. We will spend about one quarter of our class time in a workshop
format, which will allow you to give and receive feedback from an intelligent
and perceptive group of editors-your classmates-and the rest of our time in
discussion. When we discuss the texts of the class, we will do so with an eye
toward writing. The readings will range from the traditional materials of
English classes (William Shakespeare, Jane Austen) to contemporary films,
political arguments, and literary theory. As we move through those materials,
though, our focus will remain on writing, and you will prepare frequent short
writing assignments as well as four longer (at least 3-page) papers. At the
end of the term, you will submit 15 pages of your best work in a portfolio,
the grade of which will count as 60% of your grade for the course. The other
40% will be determined by the shorter writing assignments and your in-class
work.

### EXPLANATIONS OF CLASS REQUIREMENTS

Your final grade will be based on the final portfolio of writing (60%) and on
your work throughout the semester in completing thoroughly and well the
smaller assignments in the course.

The portfolio will be covered on a separate sheet. The smaller assignments can
be broken down into three roughly equal parts:

    1. Listservs (10%): At least five times during the term, you will write an essay of 150-250 word to the class listserv. Four of these have been specifically assigned in the syllabus; the fifth can be written at any time. You will be heavily encouraged to use your classmates' writing to start conversations on the listserv. 

    2. Reading Questions (15%): Reading questions will be assigned periodically to introduce questions we will be discussing in class. I will look them over to make sure you are completing and thinking about the reading. 

    3. Workshop Participation (15%): This includes three things: your work in preparing papers to be workshopped, your preparation and helpfulness in starting conversations as a respondent, and your preparation and participation in all other workshops. Your work will make the workshops happen, so this is very important. 

**All grades will be lowered by a notch for every day the assignment is
late.**

Participation in class discussions is a very important part of this class. If
you do not participate, I will lower your grade by at least one notch (i.e., B
to B-). If you do a great job of supporting our discussions, I may raise your
grade similarly.

Attendance is absolutely required. There are no "excused" absences. Because I
know that emergencies and accidents do occur during the semester, I allow you
two absences. I don't want to know why you miss class, and I don't want you to
tell me why. These absences are your business. Missing more than two classes
is equally your business, but it will also affect your grade. 3-4 absences
will lower your grade by 1/3, 5-6 by 2/3, etc. More than 12 absences will
constitute failing the course.

If you have extreme emergencies--such as a death in your immediate family, or
an extended illness requiring hospitalization or more than 10 days of bedrest
--you must give me a letter from your physician or, in the case of family
emergencies, from the College Advisor Diane Frey.

The portfolio, handed in at the end of the term, will include at least fifteen
pages of your best work. Each piece of work should be at least three pages
long, but there is not minimum number of papers to be included here. The
nature of this assignment will be explained in detail as it approaches.

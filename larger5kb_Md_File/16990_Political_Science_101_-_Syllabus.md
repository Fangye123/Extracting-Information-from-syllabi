Email: anownes@utk.edu **Introduction**     &nbspThis; course is designed to
provide students with a basic understanding of American national government
and politics. The course is divided into three sections: 1). The rules. 2).
The players. 3). The policies. In Section 1, we examine the rules of American
politics. The most basic rules of American government are found in the
Constitution. Thus, this is where we start. However, since 1787, these rules
have been changed, modified, and supplemented. "New" rules have manifested
themselves in court decisions, laws, and other forms of policy. After
discussing the rules of American politics, we move on to the players. Of
course, the most prominent players are the institutions of American national
government--Congress, the president, the judiciary, and the bureaucracy. But
these are hardly the only players. Other players include political parties,
interest groups, the media, and of course, ordinary citizens like you and me.
Finally, (if we have time) we will discuss policies--the actual outputs of
American national politics. Ultimately, understanding the rules and the
players should help us understand the hows and whys of policies.  
  
    &nbspUnfortunately;, this is a very large class. As such, we will stick to the lecture format. However, discussion will be permitted and encouraged. But I must insist that you behave yourselves, as "free for all" discussions involving hundreds of people are neither edifying nor educational.

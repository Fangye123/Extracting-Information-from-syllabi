**WEEK 15: PROJECT 3 DUE ON MAY 7**

**May 1 - Overview and class evaluations**



**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

**Course format** : The format of the course is lecture/discussion and field
experiences.

**Grades:** Grades will be assigned on the basis of three projects (25% each
for projects 1 and 2, and 35% for project 3), and class participation (15% of
the grade).

**Field labs** : Three field labs will be required. These will take place on
Saturdays (provisionally scheduled for February 19, March 25, and April 22).
Data gathered during these field labs will be the basis for the three
projects. Hence, these cannot be made up if you miss the field trip. If, for
some unavoidable reason, you must miss a field lab, you must see me
immediately to plan some form of equivalent, alternate assignment.

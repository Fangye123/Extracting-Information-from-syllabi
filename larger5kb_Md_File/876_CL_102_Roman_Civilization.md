Course description

  
This course provides an introduction to the world of ancient Romans: a
civilization whose influence defines elements of our law and politics,
language and literature, as well as many other aspects of Western society and
culture. We seek to explore these Roman ancestors of our civilization, by
studying fascinating works of Latin literature and the magnificent remains of
their material culture from a period of over 1200 years, in which they
conquered and transformed the ancient Mediterranean. During the course we
shall also reflect on how the Romans were different from us, and how our own
modern perspective influences what we appreciate of Roman civilization.

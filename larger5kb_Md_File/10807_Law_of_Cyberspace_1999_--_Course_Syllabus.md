 **Law, Code and Kids** : : Protecting Minors from Content  

Ever since Senator Exxon waved his blue book in DC, people all over the nation
have been calling for better ways to regulate the content that our children
can see. In this week we tackle the issue of library censorship through
filtering technology.

 **Rereading the First Amendment** : : When is "no law", some laws?  

This week we ask how we as a society can or should protect ourselves against
hearing or viewing questionable content. Does harmful content exist? If so,
can the government take steps to censor it? Can Microsoft? Can we?

 **Privacy** : : (Um, What Privacy?)  

This week's readings address three questions: How much privacy do we have in
cyberspace? What are the existing sources of privacy protection (technology,
law, social norms, the market)? Are there ways these sources could better
protect users' expectations of privacy?

The readings come in 6 mini-groups:  
(1) General overview (Privacy and the Internet)  
(2) The Problem (McVeigh v. Cohen)  
(3) What you reveal and how (Anonymizer; Cookies - how and why; Cookies: The
Good, The Bad, and The Ugly)  
(4) Privacy Policies and the FTC (Kidscom.com; Letter from the FTC; FTC Report
to Congress)  
(5) Big Y (BigY.com)  
(6) P3P and Other Solutions (P3P; Privacy on the Web FAQ; Privacy in
Cyberspace Executive Summary)

 **Internet Governance** : : ICANN and the DNS Mess  

Behind the World Wide Web and the Internet is the Domain Name System, the
databases and root servers that tell your computer where and how to find
"cyber.law.harvard.edu" or "disney.com". When the Internet was just a network
of computer scientists and academic departments, few people cared who
controlled the root server or assigned the names. As activity and commerce
moved online, however, the names and architecture of the 'Net took on greater
importance. The last two readings in this pack discuss the early history of
the Net and its architecture.

In 1997, President Clinton decided to move government out of the domain name
business. The Department of Commerce produced a Green Paper, then the White
Paper reproduced as the first reading, setting out principles for Internet
management.

ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a non-
profit California corporation formed to take over Internet management
functions. The news articles describe its formation. The Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws describe the corporation's basic structure: There are
now 9 initial board members. The permanent Board of Directors will have 9
representatives from Supporting Organizations (3 each from Domain Names,
Addresses, and Protocols), and 9 At-Large Directors.

Many of ICANN's details are still being worked out. In particular, the Berkman
Center has been involved in the study of membership options:  
* Who is eligible to represent the "Internet community"?   
* How can the corporation avoid capture by a minority?   
* How can the 'Net itself be used to answer these questions?   
The membership questions are still under debate, and we ask you to focus on
them in this week's readings. Included are a Berkman analysis of membership
issues raised by the White Paper and Bylaws, and the preliminary report from a
March meeting in Singapore.

Ken Hamidi, a former Intel employee and the spokesman for FACE Intel -- a
nonprofit organization of former and current Intel employees -- sent mass
e-mails to Intel employees as part of his ongoing campaign to inform employees
about what he considers to be Intel's abusive and discriminatory employment
practices. Intel Corporation brought suit in California state court against
Hamidi, alleging trespass to chattels and seeking to enjoin him from sending
mass e-mails to Intel employees at their places of work.

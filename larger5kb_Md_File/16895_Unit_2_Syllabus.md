Cinderella said to Snow White  
How does love get so off course?  
All I wanted was a white knight  
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse.  
Ride me off into the sunset  
Baby, I'm forever yours  
It's the way you love me  
It's a feeling like this--  
It's centrifugal motion  
It's perpetual bliss.  
It's that pivotal moment  
It's unthinkable  
This kiss, this kiss . . .  
                                    &nbsp--; Faith Hill, "This Kiss"

Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This course will introduce you to the history of the United States since
the New Deal. Through a study of  
---|---  
  
| documents, personal testimony, fictional accounts, discussions, lectures and
audiovisual presentations, you will  
---|---  
  
| be encouraged to think "historically" about persons, event, and social
movements during the last half-century.  
---|---  
  
| By the end of the quarter you will be able to describe the basic outlines of
the historical period and many of its  
---|---  
  
| most important figures and events. In addition, you will learn to analyze
what counts as "history," why it counts,  
---|---  
  
|  and why we continue to struggle over which "version" of the past counts for
us. This course is intended  
---|---  
  
| primarily for first year students.

---|---  
  
|  This course will acquaint students with the rich, varied history of African
Americans in the 19 states of the  
---|---  
  
| American west stretching from Texas north to North Dakota and then to the
Pacific Ocean. The topics will  
---|---  
  
| include the settlement of Spanish-speaking blacks in the American southwest,
slavery in the west, post civil war  
---|---  
  
| migrations to the high plains and to the far west. The course will examine
the role of African Americans in the  
---|---  
  
| range cattle and mining industries, as buffalo soldiers and as workers in
the 19th and 20th century urban west.  
---|---  
  
| Particular attention will be paid to the World War II migrations to
Portland, Seattle and other west coast cities  
---|---  
  
| and to the interaction of African Americans with other people of color in
the 20th century. There will be a  
---|---  
  
| particular emphasis on African Americans in the Pacific Northwest from the
antebellum period in Oregon  
---|---  
  
| throught the 1970s civil rights era in Portland, Seattle and other larger
cities of the region.  
---|---  
  
| **

Scott Rausch  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This course teaches the political, social, and cultural history of the
United States from the end of Reconstruction  
---|---  
  
| to the 1990's, with particular emphasis on the period between Word War I and
the end of the Vietnam War. In  
---|---  
  
| general, the class denonstrates how much of the nation's present is in fact
a product of very recent historical  
---|---  
  
| developments. Themes will include economic change, the uneven evolution of
American democracy, American  
---|---  
  
| popular culture, and the changing role of the United States in the world.
Successful students will further develop  
---|---  
  
|  critical thinking skills, the ability to analyze a wide variety of
historical sources, and the ability to write  
---|---  
  
| effectively as historians. Class time will involve multimedia lectures,
discusion, and in-class film viewing. The  
---|---  
  
| assigned material will cover a diversity of sources, from primary official
documents and secondary essays to  
---|---  
  
| literature to film and visual art. Students will be expected to work with
the instructor on developing effective  
---|---  
  
| writing skills.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  Previous U.S. History and writing ("W") coursework is recommended, but not
required. The class is open to all  
---|---  
  
| majors.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  Assignments include class participation, a short (2-3 pp) film review, a
research paper (7-10 pp) using primary  
---|---  
  
| sources, a take-home essay, mid-term, and a final exam. Students are
expected to follow guidelines explained in  
---|---  
  
| the course syllabus, and grades are based strictly on student performance on
class requirements. Students must  
---|---  
  
| complete every assignment in order to receive a passing grade. As per the UW
catalog guidelines, the course  
---|---  
  
| requires a minimum of 10 hours per week spent on coursework outside of the
classroom.

Suzanne Lebsock

| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  By "social history" we don't mean tea parties! We do mean attention to the
lives of ordinary people and their  
---|---  
  
| essential activities, including work (paid and otherwise), family,
sexuality, and participation in social movements,  
---|---  
  
| including feminist movements. We'll begin with the seventeenth century, when
people from three different parts  
---|---  
  
| of the world, with three very different gender systems, were thrown together
in the American Chesapeake, and  
---|---  
  
| will proceed to the present. Students should come away with an appreciation
of long term change in ideas about  
---|---  
  
| women and in the status of women; an appreciation of differences among
various groups of women; and an  
---|---  
  
| understanding of how the inclusion of women changes our view of history.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  WOMEN 200, WOMEN 283, and/or HSTAA 201 are recommended preparation but are
not required.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  This is a lecture course, but time for discussion will also be set aside,
and lectures supplemented by video  
---|---  
  
| documentaries. Students will write two take-home essay assignments (4-5 pp
each), plus a history of women in  
---|---  
  
| their own families. Grades will be based largely on the thoughtfulness and
clarity of written work, and the degree  
---|---  
  
| to which it successfully integrates the various materials of the course.
Regular attendance is mandatory.

| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This is a continuation of HSTAA 381 which surveyed the history of Latin
America from its European discovery  
---|---  
  
| until ca. 1700. The sequel is divided into three sections: (1) imperial
reforms and their consequences; (2) the  
---|---  
  
| separation of mainland Latin America from Spain and Portugal; and (3)
problems of nation formation in selected  
---|---  
  
| parts of the region. It is hoped that students will gain an enhanced
understanding of the complexities of reforms,  
---|---  
  
| of the interest groups they serve and those they offend; the reasons why
political revolution in some parts of  
---|---  
  
| Latin America was extremely violent and destructive and in other places far
less disruptive; and why nation  
---|---  
  
| building for peoples who have never been self-governing involves difficult
choices.

course.

**HSTAA 404** ** _New England: From the Foundings to 1860_**  
---  
  
|  Modern  
---|---  
  
|  
Richard Johnson  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  The class studies the history of New England from its beginnings to the
region's emergence to national political  
---|---  
  
| and economic leadership in the mid-nineteenth century. Emphasis on such
themes as Puritanism, ecological  
---|---  
  
| change, race relations, the New England town, adjustment to empire,
revolution, constitution making, the reform  
---|---  
  
| impulse, industrialism, and the rise of a market economy. Besides gaining a
fuller understanding of the  
---|---  
  
| significance of these themes for the unfolding of American history, students
will also be encouraged by the  
---|---  
  
| format of the class to sharpen their skills of critical thinking and
expression. Class discussions and written  
---|---  
  
| assignments center on the readings described below. Each weekly unit of the
readings is designed to illuminate  
---|---  
  
| some particular episode or issue in early American history, and to enable
students to assess the cultural values  
---|---  
  
| of the past and act as historians in constructing their own documented
analyses through discussion and writing.  
---|---  
  
|  This is therefore a history course in the double sense that students can
expect to learn both about the nature of  
---|---  
  
| the past (in this case one of the most formative and exciting periods of
American history) and about how to  
---|---  
  
| develop the skills of thinking and research needed for effective study of
that past, and its legacy for the present.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  No prerequisites, except a lively curiosity about the origins of American
society. During the duration of the  
---|---  
  
| course, however, regular attendance--at the lectures and more especially at
the Thursday discussions--is  
---|---  
  
| essential for success, along with a readiness to complete the assigned
readings week by week, so as to  
---|---  
  
| contribute to class discussions and the timely completion of assignments.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  Attendance at the two lectures a week, and at the third meeting, each
Thursday, given to class discussion. Two  
---|---  
  
| 5-7 page papers (a book review and an assessment of a primary source) that
can be rewritten, plus several  
---|---  
  
| one-page papers based on the weekly reading. Students will also be asked to
do small research projects of their  
---|---  
  
| own, in newspapers and on a reformer's life. No midterm but a takehome final
exam consisting of essay  
---|---  
  
| questions. Student's work will be judged according to the strength, clarity,
and concision of its arguments, its  
---|---  
  
| capacity to employ and analyze the appropriate course materials, and the
relevance of its response to its chosen  
---|---  
  
| topic. This is a W-course, with a consequent emphasis upon writing
assignments.

Douglas Jackson

Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  From waterways to railways, from the fur trade to agricultural settlement,
the History of the Canadian West offers  
---|---  
  
|  students an understanding of how the Canadians undertook to spread their
dominion from coast to coast to  
---|---  
  
| coast, struggling to overcome the difficulties associated with a vast land
composed of the Canadian Shield,  
---|---  
  
| broad stretches of prairie, foothills and high mountian peaks, stretching
through temperate to high Arctic

about the boundaries between  
---|---  
  
| Indians and non-Indians, the boundaries of "tribes," and meanings that
people gave to such racial/ethnic/tribal  
---|---

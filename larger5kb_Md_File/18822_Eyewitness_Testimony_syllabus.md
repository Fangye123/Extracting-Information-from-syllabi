COURSE DESCRIPTION**

**This is a team-taught course involving intensive study of the cognitive and
forensic aspects of memory as they apply to various points in the justice
system where human information processing, eyewitness identification, and
eyewitness testimony are employed. Computer simulations, multimedia
presentations, and mock scenarios will be used along with more traditional
teaching methods to enable experiential learning and the application of ideas
to practice.**

**This course is extensively Internet-augmented. Students will need to know
how to use the Internet to review lecture notes, keep track of course
announcements and assignments, take exams, check their grades, interact with
the instructor and other students via email, bulletin boards, and/or chat
rooms. Bookmark this <syllabus> page now as your starting point, or take note
of where the most frequently-updated page <lecture notes> takes you. You can
also access all notes for this course from the instructor's home pages.**

**COURSE OBJECTIVES**

**1\. Through lectures, readings, hands-on demonstrations and case scenarios,
students will demonstrate intellectual mastery of a knowledge base in the
eyewitness identification and testimony area.  
2\. Through discussion and experiential learning exercises such as role-
playing and computer simulations, students will fully understand the
scientific principles and concepts involved in the accuracy and reliability of
identification.  
3\. Through lectures and other teaching methods, students will be sufficiently
grounded in the rules of evidence and admissibility to enable a practical
understanding of the linkages between psychology and law.**

**COURSE EVALUATIONS**

**1\. Two (2) major exams (a midterm and a final) which count 40% of the grade  
2\. Two (2) pop quizes which count 20% of the grade  
3\. Reaction papers (to outside reading) which count 30% of the grade  
4\. Discussion and participation which count 10% of the grade**

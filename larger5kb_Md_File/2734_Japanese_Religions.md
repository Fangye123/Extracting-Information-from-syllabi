This course will be a historical and contemporary survey of religious life in
Japan, focusing on the Shinto, Buddhist, and Confucian traditions. We will pay
special attention to the ways in which religious ideas, values, and practices
are integrated into the common forms of Japanese culture today. Classes will
be a mixture of lecture and discussion.

An examination of the role of folklore in modern life, its power to
communicate critical issues through expressive culture, e.g., jokes, legends,
folksongs, graphic arts, and festival; focus on the intellectual currents
influencing the study of folklore provides further interdisciplinary
perspectives.

### Assignments:

  
Reading **assignments** are to be finished before the class session in which
they will be discussed. Informed participation in class discussions is
essential. The normal class will consist of both lecture and discussion.  
[**Collection:**](http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/archives/ColGuide.html) In
addition to the midterm and final, each student is to submit one or two items
of folklore for those sessions marked on the syllabus. (Hopefully these items
will reflect genres to be treated in subsequent sessions as well as those
already treated). These will be corrected and returned. The corrected and
revised [collection](http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/archives/ColGuide.html)
(at least 12 items) is to be turned in to the instructor during the 15th week
and will consist of the semester project. The instructor will retain and
archive the items (or a copy thereof). I expect each student to share at least
one of his or her collected "items" with the class during the semester.  
The **midterm** and **final** will consist both of objective questions (e.g.
identify, define, multiple choice, match, etc.) and of interpretative
questions (e.g. essay, interpretation, reasoned answer, discussion, position
with bases).  
University-level **literacy** is expected on all written work. **Late**
assignments will be docked one grade per week; after two weeks they cannot be
made up; makeup exams only with written doctor's excuse.  
Cell phones, beepers, pagers, etc. are not allowed in the classroom (or must
be turned off).  
Note: If you have **special needs** as addressed by the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) and need course materials in alternative formats,
notify me immediately. I will be pleased to make reasonable efforts to
accommodate your special needs.  
Finally, as Rabby Burns has said,  "the best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang
aft a-gley" (go oft awry), so I reserve the right to change the **syllabus**
according to the demands and exigencies of the semester.

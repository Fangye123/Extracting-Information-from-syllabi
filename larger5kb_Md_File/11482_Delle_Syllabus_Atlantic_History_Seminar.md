> **  
>  COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES **  
>  This course will explore recent theoretical, methodological, and thematic
developments in the archaeoiogy of the recent past. The temporal and
geographic coverage will span the historic period of the North America and the
Caribbean (c. 1500-1900). The course will concentrate on examining how
historical archaeologists use documentary and arifactual evidence in
interpreting the past, and how historical archaeology can contribute to our
understanding of the ways by which material culture has influenced the
historic definition and negotiation of race, class, gender, and ethnic
identities.  
>  **  
> COURSE FORMAT**  
>  The course, which is designed as an upper level undergraduate serninar,
will be based primarily on reading and discussion. Each student will be
expected to complete all reading assignments before the date they are due, and
to come to class prepared to discuss the material. Students will occasionally
be expectcd to lead discussion on assigned anicles and chapters. The final few
weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work; during this time students
will have the opportunity to have  "hands-on" training with a variety of
archaeological materials.

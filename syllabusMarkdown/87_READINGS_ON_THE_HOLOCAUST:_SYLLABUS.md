_**READINGS ON THE HOLOCAUST: SYLLABUS**_

_**COURSE DESCRIPTION**_

In this course we will examine some of the psychological, moral and
historiographical issues raised by the Holocaust. We will also learn and
practice some of the skills used in creating history: interpreting primary
sources, assessing secondary works, and reporting orally and in writing about
our findings.

This is an intensive reading course: We will read one or more books per week.
Most weeks two students will lead the class discussion based on questions they
prepare and distribute in advance. All other students will write short (2
page) essays or prepare questions themselves.

_**REQUIREMENTS**_

  1. This course is designed for students with substantial prior knowledge of German or Holocaust history. Thus all participants must have taken a course in the UCSB Hist 133 series, or the equivalent at another school. In the latter case, permission of the instructor is required. 
  2. Regular, active **participation** in class discussion, which counts for 40% of the final grade. 
  3. Submission of **four short papers** , about 500 words (2 double-spaced, typed pages) in length, on the weekly questions about the readings (see reverse side). Please note that I will be looking more for a coherent and thoughtful engagement with the material than a comprehensive paper that addresses all aspects of the question(s). You should be sure to _argue a thesis_ using _specific examples_ as evidence to back up your argument. These papers are due on **Tuesdays, by 2pm** , in the envelope outside my office. Each is worth 5% of your final grade (A=5, B=4,  ) for a total of 20%. 
  4. Submission of **four sets of 5-10 questions** each, about the weekly readings. Some of each set may address specific points that you don't understand; others should aim at broader issues raised by the material. These are also due on **Tuesdays, by 2pm** , in the envelope outside my office. Each question set is worth 5% of the final grade (20% altogether). 
  5. **Leading classroom discussion** for one week (this will usually be done by teams of two or more students). Each team will prepare a discussion guide with 5-10 questions, which will be distributed to all students. A "master version" with an explanation/rationale and suggested answers to those questions is due in the instructor's office on **Monday by 4pm**. Each week's team will meet with the professor on Tuesday to review their discussion plan. (20% of final grade)

In the first half of this course we will look at the evidence concerning the
history of towns as a key approach to answering the question, "when, how and
why did ancient Mediterranean culture come to an end and medieval European
culture begin?" Some of the principle evidence for this question comes from
_very_ recent work by archeologists; thus slides that we examine in class and
that you will review for the midterm will be an important source for us.

In the second half of the course we will look at medieval towns at their
height, between the eleventh and 15th centuries. We will attempt to capture a
glimpse of the lives, values, religious beliefs, problems and historical roles
of people who dwelt in medieval towns: friars, merchants, artisans, poor
people, slaves. We must always remember that these people constituted only a
small portion of medieval people: most medieval people worked and lived in the
countryside. Nevertheless, from the year 1000 on towns and townspeople were a
driving force in the take off of European society. In order to understand this
take off, we must understand the people of the towns and how they viewed the
world.

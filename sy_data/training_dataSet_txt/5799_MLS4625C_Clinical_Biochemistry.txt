COURSE DESCRIPTION



 Students study the relationship and application of clinical biochemistry to 
  the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of human disease. Lecture and laboratory 
  integrate theoretical principles and the application of analytical techniques 
  of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, enzymes, electrolytes, nitrogen metabolites, 
  inborn errors of metabolism, therapeutic drug monitoring, and toxicology. 



COURSE GOALS



This course will introduce the student to the theories and techniques of clinical 
  biochemistry. In addition, the course will expose the student to the knowledge, 
  skills and abilities required to build confidence in the practice of clinical 
  biochemistry. Achievement of these goals will lead to the production of an accomplished 
  and well-rounded clinical biochemistry professional. 



COURSE EXPECTATIONS



This course of study is structured in such a way as to provide you the opportunity 
  to understand and learn the art and science of clinical biochemistry. Learning 
  and understanding of materials taught will be made possible by attending class, 
  following directions and instructions, asking questions and participating actively 
  in the learning process. To complete the course requirements and pass the course 
  successfully, you will have to be fully committed to the learning process. To 
  this end, you must adhere to course policies and requirements.



 COURSE POLICIES 
        AND REQUIREMENTS



 Attendance: Tardiness, leaving class, 
  or not being present in class reduces your learning opportunity and consequently 
  affect your grade. Absences may result in missed laboratory exercises and lost 
  opportunity to obtain needed information. All of these will result in point 
  deductions. However, unusual circumstances resulting in tardiness and absences 
  will be considered on a case by case basis by the instructor. The circumstance 
  must be communicated to the instructor as soon as possible in the cases of tardiness 
  or within twenty-four hours from the class time missed in cases of absence. 
  You will have to negotiate make-up work with the instructor in the cases of 
  excused absences.
 Assignments: Assignments such as reading and laboratory reports must 
  be completed before class. The Laboratory Policies handout may be accessed 
  by following this link.
  Management of resources: You must prioritize 
  class time, follow instructions, and ask questions when you do not understand.
  Academic integrity: The instructor abides 
  by the FGCU policy on academic integrity.
  Grading: Based upon the following scale:

 A= 100-90%
    B= 89-80%
    C= 79-70%
    D= 69-60%
    F=<60%



Lecture:
65%
Laboratory:
35%


 
30% Two Exams; 15% each
 
35% Laboratory Exercises


 
15% Unannounced Quizzes
 
 


 
20% Comprehensive Final Exam*
 
 


*Note: a minimum score of 70% is required on the comprehensive final exam for 
  an overall course grade of B or higher. The +/- grading system will not 
  be used.

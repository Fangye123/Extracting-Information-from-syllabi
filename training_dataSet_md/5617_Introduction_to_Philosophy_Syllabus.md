I. COURSE DESCRIPTION

**

This course introduces the general nature of philosophical thought, and its
basic methods and goals. The material covered includes selections by both
historically important and current philosophers (e.g., Plato, Descartes,
Russell, Frankfurt, Williams) on such classic philosophical topics as the
existence of God, the nature of right and wrong, and the possibility of
knowledge. Through our readings and discussions we will also attempt to reach
a clearer understanding of ourselves (personhood), our relationship to other
people (moral responsibility), and our relationship to the world around us
(freedom of the will). Some of the general skills students will develop
include the formulating and defending of theoretical positions and the ability
to think critically about difficult and abstract issues.

About the Requirements:

_

_Class Participation_ \--One thing this requirement covers is your _class
attendance_ (if you don't attend class you can't participate in it). However,
to get an "A" for class participation you must do more than just show up; you
have to contribute to class discussion. You are expected to show up having
read the assignment for the day and ready to talk about it.  
**Note:** Anyone who has unexcused absences for more than half the class
meetings automatically fails the course.

_The Midterm Exam_ \--There will be a timed, in-class midterm exam at the end
of February. The exam will consist of short answer questions and an essay.

_The Required Paper_ \--There will be a **4-6 page paper** due in late March.
Topics will be distributed 2 weeks before the paper is due, and all papers are
due at the **beginning** of class on the due date. Late papers will be subject
to a substantial grade reduction (you really don't want to find out how much).

_The Optional Paper_ \--There will be a second, **optional 4-6 page paper**
due in late April. Topics will be distributed 2 weeks before the paper is due.
If your write the optional paper, then your paper grade will be the higher of
the two you receive.

_The Final Exam_ \--There will be a timed (2 hour), in-class final exam given
during the scheduled exam time for the class (5/7 for Sec. 07; 5/2 for Sec.
08). The final will consist of short answer questions and essay questions
heavily emphasizing, but not limited to, the material covered since the
midterm.

  
**

  
IV. CLASS FORMAT

**

The class will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and I want to encourage
discussion. I hope that you will all have views about the topics we will
address, and I want you to express and explore those views. It is the nature
of the issues we will be considering that people's views will differ. You are
encouraged to question your classmates (and me) when anyone says something you
disagree with, but everyone should always keep in mind that disagreement is
not a personal attack. Philosophical discussion thrives under this kind of
interaction and often stems from disagreement. At the same time, philosophical
discussion _aims at_ reaching some sort of agreement. We probably won't reach
agreement every time, but we should aspire toward it.

V. TOPICS AND READINGS

**

Most of the readings will be from the Perry and Bratman book. These will be
listed by their page numbers in parentheses. Readings from the Nagel book are
listed by chapter number.

**A note about the readings:** Philosophical writing is often subtle and
difficult. Do not be fooled by the shortness of an assignment into thinking
that it will take little time. Most of these readings should be read _at least
twice_. I recommend a first time straight through and then a second pass
taking notes.  
  
The course will be divided into 5 units. Those units and the readings for them
are as follows.

1\. Purpose, Aims, Methods

> Aquinas, "The Existence of God" (47-49)  
>  Hume, _Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion_ (57-71)  
>  Mackie, "Evil and Omnipotence" (103-110)

3\. Knowledge

> Nagel, Chapter 2  
> Descartes, _Meditations on First Philosophy_ (116-139)  
> Locke, "Some Further Considerations Concerning Our Simple Ideas of
Sensation" from _An Essay Concerning Human Understanding_ (139-144)  
>  Hume, _An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_ : Sections II-V (190-205)  
>  Salmon,  "The Problem of Induction" (230-251)  
>  Russell, "The Existence of Matter" from _The Problems of Philosophy_
(online reading)

> Campbell, "Has the Self 'Free Will'?" (417-426)  
> Taylor, "Freedom and Determinism" (437-449)  
> Frankfurt, "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person" (450-459)

5\. Morality

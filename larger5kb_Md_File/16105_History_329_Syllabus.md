**What is History 329?**  
This course is a survey of the history of the American South since the end of
the Civil War.  It assumes a basic familiarity with general American history
during the same period.  This course fulfills the Historical Studies component
of the General Education requirements.  We will follow a chronological outline
but will emphasize certain themes:  
\--race: what is the role of race in southern society; what was the nature of
race relations; how did  
 the racial system change over time?  
\--class and economic structures: what were the bases of the southern economy
and how did that  
 change; what were the experiences of and relations between different economic
classes; what social impact did economic change have?  
\--political power: who had political power and how did they use it; what were
the challenges to  
 southern political structures; how did southern politics change over time?  
In addition we will touch on religion, intellectual and cultural currents, and
the roles of women.

**Assignments**  
Book assignments (2 X 10%): You will read three historical monographs in this
course.  You will have to write a paper on two of them (your choice).  Each
paper will be approximately three pages.  You will be given a question on the
book at least a week in advance.  
Exams (3 X 20%): In this class there are three tests.  The first is February
10, the second on March 21.  The third test will be during the final exam
period on April 26.  It  will only cover the final third of the material so
you will be given the same hour and 15 minutes you had for the other two
tests.  Each test will consist of essay and short answer questions.  You will
be given study questions at least a week in advance.  
Biography assignment (15%): Each student will find in the library a biography
or autobiography of a person who lived in the South during the period covered
by the course.  You will write a paper of approximately five pages putting the
person's life into the context of the course.  An assignment sheet will be
given out by mid-semester.  This paper is due by Monday April 24th at 430 pm
in the History Department office at the latest.  They can be turned in any
time earlier than that.  
Participation (5%): Students will be graded on their participation in class
discussion.

**Rules**  
Students with disabilities: If you need extra time taking the tests or other
special arrangements please see me as soon as possible.  
Attendance: I do not take attendance.  However, since you will be held
responsible for everything that is said in class, you must find out what you
missed.  Since participation in discussion is part of your grade, you should
be here in order to participate.  
Papers: Papers are due in class on the date assigned.  Because we will be
discussing the papers in class late papers are not accepted if you are in
class.  Late papers are accepted if you have to miss class with the following
excuses: serious illness with doctor's note verifying the incapacitation,
documented death in the immediate family.  Scheduled University functions will
not count as excuses as it is possible for you to turn the paper in early.  In
addition, computer problems are not acceptable excuses.  Please note: Late
papers will only be accepted if the student speaks to the professor privately,
in advance.  Messages may be left for the professor at the history department
at any time BEFORE the class the paper is due.  This rule applies to the
biography paper as well.  
Exams: Make up exams are allowed only in case of serious illness with doctor's
note verifying the incapacitation, documented death in the immediate family,
or scheduled and prior- approved University functions.  In case of one of
these problems you must call the professor either before or during the exam
(see the above).

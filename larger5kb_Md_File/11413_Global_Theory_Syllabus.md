### 1\. ON SOCIAL THEORY AND THEORIZING

  
The dialectical relationships between representative theories or schools of
thought and the particular sociohistorical contexts in which they emerge
constitute the major focus of the approach taken in this course

### II. SELECTED NONWESTERN TRADITIONS

  
It is, of course, impossible to explore all of the major nonwestern traditions
of social theory in one semester. Consequently, we will examine only a few
representative social thinkers in traditions from Asia, Africa, and Latin
America, to begin this experimental investigation.  
  
  
  
**A. MOHANDAS K. GANDHI  
** Gandhi may be remembered as one of the great thinkers of our time and we
will begin with him because he serves as a bridge from postmodern to modern
and premodern social thought as well as between western and nonwestern,
scientific and spiritual traditions. Not a systematic social theorist, Gandhi
nonetheless made important intellectual contributions, as well as those more
explicitly political and spiritual which are interwoven with his social
theory.

9/11  
**B. ANCIENT ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT  
** K'ung Fu Tzu, known in the West as Confucius (551-497 B.C.E.) had a
profound impact for centuries on a culture that is now a major alternative to
Western culture. K'ung Fu Tzu himself lived in the chaotic "Period of the
Warring States." Just as the French founders of the sociological tradition
focused on the social order in the chaotic aftermath of the French Revolution,
so too K'ung Fu Tzu elaborated a hierarchical system designed to mitigate
chaos and preserve peace and order imposed at all levels of society.  
The Vedic texts constitute another basic foundation of Asian thought dating
back at least several thousand years; according to tradition, they having no
original date at all since they have always existed. They continue to have a
profound impact on the everyday life as well as the intellectual traditions of
a society that comprises almost one billion people.  
Gautama Buddha (563-483 B.C.E.) rebelled against his social and class
situation as the son of a powerful Indian Raj; he forged an ethical and social
theory that became the basis of a religious movement that swept across Asia
2,000 years ago and now informs social and religious thought worldwide.  
We conclude this section with an essay by Japanese intellectual Kamei
Katsuichiro (b. 1907) who raises questions about "modernization" and proposes
a return to "Asian ideals," notably those espoused by Gandhi.

**9/18  
C. THE AFRICAN DIASPORA**  
A major outcome of the convergence of slavery and colonialism was the creation
of what some now call an  "African Diaspora," consisting in large part of the
descendants of slaves taken from Africa to Europe and the Americas. In this
section, we will look at the development of social thought in contemporary
Africa (especially Otite 1978) and among people of African descent elsewhere.

D. ISLAMIC SOCIAL THOUGHT  
** Many of the more volatile political conflicts of the late twentieth century
are between various groups and members of the Muslim community, especially
from the Middle East (or "West Asia") through much of Africa and South and
East Asia. This section will survey some of the social theories from this
diverse body of thought, from the important Medieval thinker Ibn Khaldun to
North American Malcom X and contemporary Muslim scholars. We will again
encounter anticolonialism, since most of the Muslim world was conquered by
European colonial powers in the nineteenth century.

E. INDIGENOUS AMERICAN SOCIAL THOUGHT**  
As a consequence of the colonial conquest of the Americas, much of the
indigenous culture there was destroyed. Indigenous cultures in the Americas
and elsewhere had rich social theories, however, some of which have been
preserved in various forms and to various degrees, despite obvious contact and
influence from other cultures, especially from the West.

## III. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES

**  
** 10/9 **  
A. THEORIES OF LIBERATION  
** Just as modern Western social thought emerged as part of a struggle for
freedom from the constrictions of the ancien regime in medieval Europe, so
nonwestern thought focuses in large part on freedom from the structures that
bind people outside of the West. Consequently, such phenomena as colonialism,
racism, and patriarchy loom large in nonwestern social theories of liberation.
Various liberation movements based on gender, race, class, and other criteria,
have given rise to a number of significant theories about human behavior and
social structure. In this section, we will sample some that appear
particularly important.  
  
1\. Anticolonialism  
A central aspect of reality for much of the nonwestern world has been
colonialism, which thus set the stage for twentieth century social theory.
This form of domination is in turn based on a number of other significant
social phenomena, notably early capitalism, military conquest, racism, and
cultural imperialism. We have already encountered this phenomenon in our study
of Gandhi, who challenged Britain's control over India, the "jewel in the
crown," and shook the foundations of the colonial system.

**10/16  
2\. Liberation Theology**  
Despite a substantial secularization of Western intellectual culture, most of
the world interprets the world in religious frames and with religious synthols
and rhetoric. Out of an interaction between post-Vatican II Roman Catholicism
and the poor of Latin America came a socio-religious movement that provided a
powerful critique of capitalism and structures of domination that combined
Marxist social analysis with Christian theology.

**3\. Racism and Ethnocentrism**  
The confluence of systems of social stratification constructed on arbitrarily-
defined criteria such as race and ethnicity with those of slavery and
colonialism had a profound impact on social life on **** the planet and gave
rise to some important insights into social processes of domination among
their victims.

**10/23  
4\. Women's Liberation**  
Within each society of both West and East, patriarchal systems of domination
have become a significant source of social theorizing about a type of social
differentiation that has deep roots and creates social and personal problems
with no simple solutions. Although the modern feminist movement has its roots
in the Western Enlightenment, we shaff focus in this course on women of color
and their search for liberation.

**5\. Human Rights, Ecology, and Alternative Economic Development**  
The contemporary notion of  "human rights" comes primarily from the European
Enlightenment and often has an individualistic conceptual frame rejected by
traditional cultures. It has been incorporated into and elaborated by many in
the nonwestern world, where it often synthesizes the political rights from
Western democratic theory with economic rights of Marxism and socialism.
Consequently, the human rights movement--although extremely diverse in nature
--constitutes a major focal point for efforts to develop a minimal global
consensus on the bottom line of how people can have decent lives together on
the planet without exploiting vulnerable social groups or the natural
environment.

**10/30  
B. STRUCTURES OF DOMINATION AND DIFFERENTIATION **  
Theories of liberation grow out of theories of domination, of course, and
nonwestern social thought, like mainstream social theory, is much concerned
with structures of domination. Contemporary nonwestern and nonwhite theories
of domination are not developed independently of Western thought, of course,
especially Marxism, which provides much of the inspiration for studies of
domination.

C. THEORIES OF PEACE AND CONFLICT**  
A related substantive issue concerns the emergence of nonviolent social change
and a rethinking of social conflict that emerges primarily from Gandhi and
U.S. civil rights movement. I consider this to be one of the major
contributions of nonwhite social theory to contemporary understandings of
social life.

D. SPIRITUALITY, RELIGION, AND HEALTH  
** Much of the world remains steadfastly religious, despite secularizing
trends, and significant cultural reactions against modernity (and
postmodernity?) take the form of religious traditionalism (sometimes called
"fundamentalism"). In the Arab world, Islam has an elective affinity with.
anticolonial and antiwestern forces; in Latin America, liberation theology has
seized portions of the Christian church from elites and turned it into a
legitimator of popular dissent and, in some cases, even revolution. Although
western scientific medicine has gained a high status in much of the world,
traditional healing methods -- usually associated with spiritual traditions --
persist and raise fundamental questions about western theories of health and
wellbeing.

E. THE STATE, POLITICS, AND NATIONALISM  
** Contemporary theory in the nonwestern world is much concerned with the role
of the state and issues of nationalism, again in large part as a result of
efforts to define identities and to understand the world in a postcolonial
context. As if the world were not complicated enough in its formal
organization (nation states, alliances, etc.) we will also explore alternative
modes of viewing largescale social organization and political decision making
that emerge in opposition to formal structures which are, by definition,
usually controlled by western forces.

F. COMMUNITY, SEXUALITY, AND FAMILY**

> Finally, much of the social thought emerging in the nonwhite world centers
around such issues as community, sexuality, and the family, in part because of
the perception of a disintegrating influence by dominant Western culture.

**IV. TOWARDS A GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY**  
In the last class session we will review and synthesize the discussions of the
semester, attempting to identify emergent themes from the course and areas of
future exploration.

## ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING

This course will be organized as a seminar and all participants will be
expected to contribute to the collective process of learning. In addition to
collaborative learning, everyone will engage in their own projects. Grading
will be based on the quality of the following assignments:  
  
**Plan I [reviews & essay option]:  
*** in-class presentation 20%  
* annotated bibliography 10  
* 2 critical reviews of readings 40  
* take-home final essay 30  
  
**Plan II [paper option ]**  
* in-class presentation 20%  
* annotated bibliography 10  
* research paper 70  
  
In-class presentations on selected (unassigned) readings for each of the major
topics of the course, providing background information and analysis that goes
beyond the assigned readings and sets them in context. They should be
supplemented with annotated bibliographies. Both critical reviews and
bibliographies should be submitted electronically so that they can be put on
the class web site and thus made available to everyone in the class. Critical
reviews or term papers may be written on topics within the same area as the
class presentations.

##  THE FOUR QUESTIONS TEST

  
As we move through the course, we shall apply the "four questions test" to
each of the authors and traditions we are discussing. This set of questions is
adapted from my survey of Western sociological theory, and one of the tasks of
this course is to ask if they are adequate for evaluating social theories and
their domain assumptions.

> 1\. How can we best obtain knowledge of, and develop theories concerning,
social life?  
>  \--general goals and orientations of the field  
>  \--relationship to other sciences, other modes of inquiry  
>  \--preferred methods  
>  \--preferred rhetoric  
>  2\. What is the perceived relationship between the individual and society?  
>  \--view of human nature?  
>  \--realist or nominalist (collectivistic or individualistic)?  
>  \--theory of action?  
>  \--theories of identity, power, and stratification?  
>  3\. What is the nature of modern society?  
>  \--how does it differ from pre-modern?  
>  \--What are its assets and liabilities? how is it evaluated?  
>  4\. How do we interpret the social change or revolution explored by the
theorist?  
>  \--What kind of revolution was it?  
>  \--What kind of revolution do we need? (how to organize; against what?)  
>  \--What is the role of the sociologist (or scholar) in social change?  
>  \--value-free scholarship to "loosen the soil" (Weber)  
>  \--science-based moral critique and involvement (Durkheim, Marx)

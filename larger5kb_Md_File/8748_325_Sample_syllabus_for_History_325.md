### History 325  
Introduction to Women's History: The American Experience



This course surveys the history of diverse groups of American women from pre-
European-settlement to the present. Through lectures and discussions of
assigned readings, we will consider the experiences of women of different
classes, races, sexualities, and ethnic groups with work, family, sexuality,
and politics. Regular attendance and informed participation in discussions is
essential to success in this class, so it is important to complete the
assigned reading carefully and on time. Short lectures will provide a
narrative of women's history in the context of what is sometimes called the
"master narrative," and readings will focus on expanding and revising that
narrative by exploring the experiences of Native American, African American,
Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Asian American, Jewish, Appalachian, working-
class, and lesbian women.



**Course objectives:**

  1. The student will gain an understanding of American women's lives in the past. 
  2. The student will become familiar with the ways that race, class, and ethnicity interact with gender in shaping the experiences of individuals. 



**Required Books:** available for purchase at SBX and also on reserve in the
undergraduate library.

  1. Vicki L. Ruiz and Ellen Carol DuBois, _Unequal Sisters: A Multicultural Reader in U.S. Women's History_ , 2nd ed. (1994) (abbreviated as _US_ ).

**Course Requirements:**

  1. _Examinations_ : There will be a midterm and comprehensive final examination. Both will be open-book essay examinations, and I will give a list of potential questions in advance. The midterm will account for 20% of the final grade, the final for 30%. 
  2. _Class participation_ : Lively and informed discussion of the reading, not just attendance. 20% 
  3. _Group projects_ : Students will organize into groups, based on chronological interest, pick a particular year, and collectively present as comprehensive as possible a picture of what life was like for different groups of women. Class readings can of course be used as background, but in addition students are expected to draw upon primary sources such as memoirs, diaries, published correspondence, published oral histories, interviews (for recent periods), and so on. Groups will present in class during the last week and each student will turn in a separate paper of approximately 10 pages on her/his particular research. The paper will account for 30% of the grade.

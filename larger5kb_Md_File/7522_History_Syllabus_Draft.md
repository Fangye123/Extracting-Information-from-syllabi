> This new course, offered for the first time this Fall 1998, is an
experiment, bringing together several overlapping objectives.

>

>> _First_ , it seeks to explore Oberlin's distinctive history in the context
of American history, understanding and evaluating the past of this special
multicultural community in relation to national narratives; probing, refining,
and perhaps at times challenging our understandings of American history.

>>

>> _Second_ , it invites students to undertake research in the materials of
local history in order to both understand and contribute to the writing of
Oberlin's past, particularly for lesser documented periods in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

>>

>> _Third_ , it assists students in integrating new digital technologies into
the ways in which historical research is conducted and the ways in which
historical materials are presented.

>>

>> _Fourth_ , it seeks to partner Oberlin College students exploring Oberlin
history with teachers and students in the Oberlin Public Schools also studying
community history. It envisions college students collaborating in the schools
on the researching, recording, and learning about the history of Oberlin,
particularly using new electronic technologies to search for and to share the
rich and diverse heritage of this city.

>

> To these ends, the course combines analysis of primary and secondary
readings with an introduction to the ways in which historians and teachers
have begun to bring electronic media into their classrooms. Students are
required to undertake an original reserach project, and are encouraged to
choose a project coordinated with the curriculum of a teacher in the Oberlin
Public Schools. I try to help you match your interests with those of a
teacher.

>

> For the first half of the semester, the class will meet twice weekly, on
Tuesdays and Thursday from 1 to 2:50 pm. Some class meetings, as indicated on
the syllabus, will be held in the Biggs Computer Lab in Stevenson Hall. The
class will also meet once in the Oberlin College Archives, and once at the
Oberlin Historical and Improvement Organization. We will also take one walking
"field trip."

>

> We will also gather for three Saturday lunches to discuss with Oberlin
Public School teachers grade-specific tasks and capacities for the study of
local history. Although subject to change, the lunches are tentatively
scheduled for the following Saturdays:

>

>> > September 19  
>  October 3  
>  October 10  
>

>

> For the second half of the semester, the class will hold scheduled meetings
as a group only on Tuesday. Each Thursday, some students will be scheduled to
meet with me.

history. Your choice of project and your method of presentation may be
influenced by your collaboration with a public school teacher and/or class.
Projects may be presented in traditional textual form, or may use alternate
electronic formats, or may involve a combination of both. As a guideline, you
should think about the equivalent of a final paper 10-20 pages in length. The
instructor and the student course assistant welcome discussions about topics,
formats, research strategies, and other creative approaches to the study and
presentation of history.

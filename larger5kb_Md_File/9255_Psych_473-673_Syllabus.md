    DEFINITIONS
    
    Cheating: For the purposes of this class, cheating can be defined as any use of fraud or deceit in an attempt to influence the grade on an assignment or test. 
    
    Plagiarism  (from the Modern Language Association of America Handbook, 1988, New York; 21-23):
    
    Plagiarism is the act of using another person's ideas or expressions in your writing without acknowledging the source.  In short, to Plagiarize is to give the impression that you have written or thought something that you have in fact borrowed from someone else.
    
    You may certainly use another person's words and thoughts in your writing, but you must acknowledge the authors.  Failure to do so can bring severe penalties, up to expulsion from a class.
    
    Examples
    
    The most blatant form of Plagiarism is to repeat as your own someone else's sentences, more or less verbatim.  Suppose, for example, that you want to use the material in the following passage, which appears on page 906 in Volume I of the Literary History of the United States.
    
            The major concerns of Dickinson's poetry early and late, her "flood subjects," may be defined as the seasons and nature, death and a problematic afterlife, the kinds and phases of love, and poetry as the divine art.
    
    If you write the following without any documentation, you have committed plagiarism:
    
            The chief subjects of Emily Dickinson's poetry include nature and the seasons, death and the afterlife, the various types and stages of love, and poetry itself as a divine art.
    
    But you may present the information if you credit the authors:
    
            Gibson and Williams (1993) suggest that the chief subjects of Emily Dickinson's poetry include death, love, and poetry as a divine art.
    
    Other forms of Plagiarism include repeating someone else's particularly apt phrase without appropriate acknowledgment, paraphrasing another person's argument as your own, and presenting another's line of thinking as though it were your own.
    
    IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE COMMITTING PLAGIARISM, CITE YOUR SOURCE OR SOURCES.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

> This course surveys changes in American society from World War II to the end
of the 1950s. In this era Americans altered their thinking about ideals that
had dominated public opinion during the war: the acceptance of traditional
forms of authority, loving and supportive relationships between men and women,
ideas of generational and racial harmony. Postwar films such as _It's a
Wonderful Life_ and film characters like George Bailey represented a hope that
some of those ideals would be preserved after the war. Other images from the
postwar period, however, subverted dreams for a "wonderful life." In films
like _A Streetcar Named Desire_ and _Blackboard Jungle_ we get a different
picture of the times--one that reveals more discord and turbulence than
citizens had hoped for when they won the "good war." At the end of the course
we will examine the most famous symbol of change and social disorder in the
fifties: Elvis Presley. We will explore the manner in which Elvis represented
broader changes that were taking place in American society after 1945. George
Bailey ended up curbing his personal desires for the sake of family and
community needs. Elvis stood for the idea that Americans could now dream of
moving beyond the world into which they were born, such as lower-class life
and conventional roles like fatherhood and motherhood. Bailey was a symbol of
the period before 1945 when people were asked to sacrifice many of their
personal ambitions. Elvis was a symbol that said such sacrifice might not be
necessary.

also be posted on the web site.  
  
**TESTS AND GRADES:** There will be three tests and three quizzes for the
course. Each test will include at least one essay question that will require
you to blend lecture, reading, and film material. Thus, you should take
careful notes of the films you watch in class. Each of the three quizzes will
be about a book we discuss in class and will consist of one essay question.
**You will receive a set of three or four possible questions for each book in
advance, and your quiz will come from the list of questions you receive.** See
your _syllabus_ for the dates of the quizzes and tests including the final
exam. Each test will be worth a total of 25 points. Each of the three quizzes
is worth 8 points. You get one point for taking the course. Your goal should
be to accumulate 100 points for the course.  
  
**MAKE-UP TESTS:** Make-ups are given only with the permission of the
instructor and only for very good reasons.  
  
**PLAGIARISM:** Plagiarism, which is the representation of someone's work as
your own, will not be tolerated and can be grounds for failing the entire
course.  
  
**DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR:** The Indiana University "Guidelines for Dealing with
Disruptive Students in Academic Settings" states that "all students are
expected to be in compliance with Indiana University's _Code of Student
Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct_." Misconduct may be personal as well as
academic, and can include sexual and racial harassment or behavior which
interferes with the learning process. If a student becomes disruptive or
engages in any form of misconduct, he or she can be removed from the class.

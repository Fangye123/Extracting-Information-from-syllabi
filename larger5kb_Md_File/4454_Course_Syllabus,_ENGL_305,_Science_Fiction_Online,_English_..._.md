comments and participate in online discussion groups which will be set up for
the class.  
**Plagiarism / Cheating** |  The unacknowledged use of the words/ideas/

catch you plagiarizing, or cheating in any way, you will receive a grade of
"0" on the assignment in question, the violation may be reported to University
authorities, and you may fail the course.

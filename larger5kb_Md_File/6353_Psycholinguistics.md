Theory/Assessment revisited.

Folks: Forgive the fact that this award winning drama
["Lottery"](Lottery.mov)" was documented with a handheld camera. You will have
to view it a number of times. The conflict that the actors played out was
exactly the same as the one you witnessed in class last week. It also relates
to Frost poem, "A Tuft of Flowers." Study these to better understand what
meaning can be derived from this situated incident. You might follow the
methodology in class: recording, reporting, generalizing, and theorizing. Be
prepared to discuss your insights in class this week. (``[A tuft of
Flowers](flowers.mov) `)

* _Critique_ : "an act of criticizing; esp.: a critical examination or estimate of a thing or situation (as a work of art or literature) with a view to determining its nature and limitations or its conformity to standards." ( **Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged**. G.  & C. Merriam. Springfield, Mass. 1966.)

Don't feel limited in critiquing written essays or reports; explore a variety
of texts, including aural and visual texts. In Reserve in the Library, there
are issues of **Research in the Teaching of English** , and adjacent there are
tapes of speeches delivered at professional conferences. One of these
critiques must be of tapes, and a second should be of some work found in
E.R.I.C. Identify each critique with your name, date, letter of critique, and
code. Each critique should be written for your peers, no longer than a half
sheet of paper.

A critique of a text should entertain such questions as these: What is the
world the author inhabits (i.e. what are the range and depth of his/her
concerns)? What are his/her predominant attitudes toward that inhabited world?
What distinguishes his/her style (consider such matters as vocabulary,
sentence and paragraph structures, choice of subject, uses of figurative
language, allusions, degrees of subjectivity and objectivity)? To what
audiences and for what ends is the author addressing himself/herself? A
critique of a work on composition should entertain such questions as these: On
what authority and for what audience does the author write? What important
ideas does he/she offer? How are those ideas organized and presented? What
classroom practices follow explicitly or implicitly from these ideas? Do the
ideas/practices appear to be sound? Why or why not? Does the author
himself/herself appear to be an accomplished stylist? Explain. In writing,
assume that you intend to publish the critique in a professional journal for
English teachers and the audience is unfamiliar with the work you are
analyzing. Your purpose is primarily informative and secondarily persuasive.

**FOUR CURRENT SCHOOLS OF THEORY**

The **Expressivists** and **Cognitivists** , often referred to as **Process
Approaches** ; the **Social Constructionists Approaches** , and the
**Interactivist Approaches**.

Read articles from professional journals for critiquing from the bibliography
below. Your critique will include a summation, plan, analysis of influence,
and personal response. Each critique will be no more than a half page.

Acknowledging the verity that "we categorize at our peril," I have listed
important works according to the four current schools of composition theory.

**DESCRIPTION  
**

This course will explore advanced concepts and technologies for interfacing
humans to complex machines, with a focus on virtual interfaces and their
potential impact on the way we think about computers and the way we think with
them. Interface design principles will be reviewed from human factors and
technological perspectives. Hardware, software and mindware aspects of virtual
interfaces and virtual environments will be investigated and applications
postulated and designed in the fields of medicine, education, design and
entertainment.  

**APPROACH  
**

The course will consist of faculty and guest lectures, video presentations and
field trips with open discussions in a seminar setting. The course can be
taken for either one credit or three credits.  

**PREREQUISITES  
**

An interest in human-computer interaction and virtual reality. Recommended
prerequisites for the course include a graduate student standing and a
background (or at least introductory courses) in psychology, perception, and
physics and electronics). Waiver of these requirements may be given by
permission of the instructor. Entry code required. Please contact DJ Miller in
the IE department for entry information (ieadvise@u.washington.edu)  

**DAY/TIME/PLACE  
**

Winter Quarter 1998

Tuesdays/Thursdays, 2:00-3:20P

**CREDITS  
**

Variable credit will be given for this course. Students may sign up for either
1 or 3 credit hours:  

1 credit hour students are required to attend lectures, participate in group
discussions, and complete class assignments.  

3 credit hour students are required to accomplish the above plus conduct a
group research project to be documented in a written research paper and web
site. Each group will also give two in-class presentations of 10 minutes on
their research project. The paper and web site will consist of the equivalent
of at least 15 typewritten (double-spaced) pages (excluding references). The
paper will be graded on the basis of its scholarship, rigor, critical thinking
and completeness. The research paper is due by 5:00P on 12 March 1998. There
will be no final for this course.  

**GRADING  
**

The following grading profile will be used in computing the final grade for
the course:  

1 credit students:

35%--attendance and participation in class discussions

65%--class assignments  

3 credit students:

10%--attendance and participation in class discussions

30%--class assignments

60%--research report  

NOTE: Extra credit will be given to students for participating as subjects in
virtual interface experiments in the Human Interface Technology Laboratory.

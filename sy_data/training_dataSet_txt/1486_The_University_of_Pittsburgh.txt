Our vast land is great and rich but there is no order
here. Come along and rule over us.(Primary Chronicle)
With the mind alone Russia cannot be understood,
No ordinary yardstick spans her greatness:
She stands alone, unique -
In Russia one can only believe.
(Fedor Tiutchev)
I. Course Description
This is a guided tour through Russian medieval and
early 18th-century culture. My aim is to demonstrate the
dramatic changes in the history of Russia's national idea, the
richness and variety of Russian culture of the discussed period and
its crucial importance for the development of modern Russian
culture. We will focus our attention on three successive eras of
Russia's cultural history -- Kievan Rus' (9-13 c.), the Muscovite
Tsardom (13-17 c.), and the rise of the Russian Empire, centered on
St. Petersburg (18 c.). The class will examine such artifacts as
icons, architecture, sculpture, literature, and painting, as well
as some basic theological, political, and aesthetic theories.
Reading assignments will draw from historical (MacKenzie, Curran),
art history (Hamilton), and literary (Zenkovsky) sources. Class
lectures will be supplemented by frequent slide, video, and musical
presentations.
II. Course Methodology
Class consists of lecture, discussion, occasional
quizzes, and two in-class, closed-book exams. The introduction of
each section of the course will place the works of art under
investigation in their actual historical and cultural context.
III. Required Texts and Materials

Hamilton, George Heard. The Art and Architecture
of Russia. 3rd ed. New Haven: Yale UP, 1983.
MacKenzie, David and Michael W. Curran. A History
of Russia, the Soviet Union, and Beyond. 5th ed. 	Belmont, CA:

Zenkovsky, Serge A., ed. Medieval Russia's Epics,

IV. Suggested Reading

Billington, James. The Icon and the Axe: An
Interpretative History of Russian Culture. NY: Random House, 1970
Rzhevsky, Nicholas. An Anthology of Russian
Literature, any edition.
NB!!! Required three-ring hole punch and

V. Course Requirements

Attendance (see #6) and class participation. More
than three unexcused absences will reduce your grade dramatically
-- no exceptions!
Midterm and final examinations will include two
parts each:

identifications: what's The Time of Troubles?
a short essay on a topic previously given in
class

The Midterm Exam will be in class on Thursday,
October 25. The Final Exam must be taken at the time scheduled by
the Registrar in order to receive credit for this course.
VI. Attendance Policy and Class Participation
Attendance and participation in class discussion are
required, and are incorporated into the course grade in the
following ways:

Attendance counts for 10% of your grade. Since
there are 28 class meetings (twice a week for fourteen weeks),
every absence reduces the attendance portion of your grade by
1/28.
Participation counts for 10% of your grade. To
earn an A for class participation, students are expected to
participate meaningfully in class discussion at least 1/3 of the
time (9-10 times during the semester). Absence means that you are
unable to earn participation credit on that day.
To makeup examinations or quizzes will be given
unless documentation of a medical emergence is provided the day the
student returns to class. Unexcused absence on the day of
examination or quiz is given results in no credit for that
examination or quiz.
Much of the material covered in this course
(and incorporated into examinations and quizzes) is introduced in
lecture and through classroom discussion. Absence means a loss of
access to this material, which likely averse consequences on
examinations and quizzes. Students are responsible for obtaining
notes from their classmate about sessions they may miss due to
absence.

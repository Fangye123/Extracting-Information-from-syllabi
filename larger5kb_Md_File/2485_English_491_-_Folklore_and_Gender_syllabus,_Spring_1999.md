Through the written and oral literature, the films, and the material objects
that we meet in this folklore course, we will explore several aspects of the
traditional culture of women and men. We'll use the perspectives open to us
when we ask questions about gender: How does the gender of the performer and
the audience influence the contruction of the text? Given the pressure to
conform to roles and ways of being and given the devaluation of women's voices
and work, how are women able to create what they wish? How do they subvert,
reject, transform these judgments? What role do the products and processes of
traditional culture--such as stories and storytelling, quilts and quilting--
play in both the maintenance and the transformation of stereotypic gender role
behavior?

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**  
  
1\. **Class participation.** 30%. You'll be working in groups a lot and
writing regular response papers. More than two absences will affect your
grade. And, when you're not present, the other members of your group will find
it harder to do their work.  
If you cannot commit to attending class regularly, I recommend that you drop
this course.  
**(A.) Response Papers** : To facilitate discussion, we'll be dividing our
class into **four groups** : Group 1, 2, 3, 4. The syllabus indicates which
group is responsible for which reading. For a "Group 1" reading, for example,
everyone in class is responsible for reading the assigned text, but I will
only call on members of "Group 1" in class. Anyonefrom any groupmay talk about
any reading, however.  
If you see **a * by a reading** , that sign means that only the group
designated needs to read that text. Everyone is responsible, though, for the
material from that article that is discussed in class.  
  
**When it's your group's turn** , you'll each answer these questions on
**one** sheet of paper:  
  
1\. What do you think was one of the most important ideas in today's reading?
(Give page numbers)  

2\. What feature of the day's reading interested you the most? (Give page
number)  

3\. What question would you like to have discussed today concerning this
reading? (Give page number, if relevant)  

  
You may mix and match these questions. For example, one day you may not have a
question you'd like to discuss, so list three most important ideas about the
reading. Or, one day there may not be any difference between the ideas you
think are important and those that interested you. As long as you hand in a
page with three observations on it, you've fulfilled the assignment. Please
label clearly, though, the titles: "most important," `interested me,"
"question."  
  
Please **make two copies** of your response paper, and bring them both to
class. Place one on my desk. As class begins, you'll exchange your papers with
other group members before we begin our discussion. I'll return a copy to you,
sometimes with comments.  
These pages will help you focus your thoughts in preparation for class, for
papers, and for exams; they'll help me follow your progress in the class and
give me an indication of the effectiveness of the reading assignments.  
  
I'll accept for credit **only typewritten** materials that have been prepared
before class. Be sure to include your **name, your group number, the title**
of the reading, and the number of the response paper.  
As with any paper for a course, be sure to keep a copy in case there's any
question about your work at semester's end.  
  
**(B.) Short response writings.** While the Group responsible for the day's
reading exchanges their papers, the rest of the class will write short
responses to the day's reading. Sometimes, I'll collect your page at the end
of class.  
  
2\. **Paper 1**. 10%. 2 pages.  
  
3\. **Paper 2**. 30%. Six pages of text, minimum, exclusive of bibliography;
no maximum length. I encourage you to include photos, charts, etc., but these
figures do not fulfill part of the six page requirement. Typed, double-spaced,
standard margins, 10-12 point font, bibliography (see a grammar text for
examples of in-text citation and bibliographic form). Options: research alone
or fieldwork and research.  
Includes Semester Project Poster Sessions. 1-2 pages, 14 point print or more,
of a story or a quotation from your informantsomething from your Semester
Fieldwork Project that you can hang on the wall and discuss with other
students as they read it.  
  
4\. **Exam questions**. 30% Instead of a midterm and a final exam, I'll be
asking you to write what I call  "exam questions" throughout the semester.
I'll give you two kinds of questions: in- class and take-home.  
From time to time, I'll ask you to write for about ten minutes on the reading
you've prepared for class that day or for that day and several days before.
Sometimes I'll announce the questions ahead of time; other times, I'll just
begin or end class by asking you to write.  
I'll also be assigning one to three two-page essays on class readings. I'm
trying this format because I want to encourage you to keep up with your
reading and because I think that these questions, interspersed throughout the
semester, will reinforce learning better than an exam would at semester's end.  
**Exam question on Duffy's play Grimm Tales or Gordon's storytelling .** Write
a page-long essay about any issue that you'd like after you attend one of
these two events (see Text and Community schedule, below). **Due 14 April.**  
  
  
____________________________________________________  
  
**My late paper policy:** All papers and exam questions are due in class, at
the beginning of class, on the day of the assignment. Short Response papers
are due at the end of class. Papers left in my mailbox, papers handed in later
that day are late papers.  
If you talk with me _before_ the day that the paper is due, I will discuss the
possibility of your handing in your paper at another time.  
If you are sick on the day of the paper, call me during office hours or leave
a message at #1172. Do not use e-mail for this message). If you contact me in
these ways and bring your paper in during the next class, I will not deduct
anything from your grade.  
If you hand your paper in late--that is, any time after our class on the date
listed, I will take off one letter grade. All late papers must be in to me
within one week of the due date.  
  
**Exam policy** : I re-schedule exam questions only in the event of illness or
a death in the family. If you miss an exam because of illness, have someone
call me at #31172 on the day of the exam. To re-schedule an exam, bring a
doctor's excuse and come talk to me as soon as you're back in school. If you
miss an exam due to a death in the family, call me before or on the day of the
exam. To re-schedule the exam, bring me a copy of the funeral bulletin or any
other printed document and come talk with me. In-class exam questions cannot
be made-up for credit, but I will not penalize you if you have an excused
absence.  
  
**English Department statement on plagiarism**. Plagiarism means using the
words, opinions, or factual information from another person without giving the
person credit. Writers give credit through accepted documentation styles such
as parenthetical citation, footnotes, or end notes. A simple listing of books
and articles at the end of a paper is not sufficient. Plagiarism is the
equivalent of intellectual robbery and cannot be tolerated in the academic
setting.  
  
**University workload policy:** Many GMU students work in order to meet
expenses, and each student needs to find an appropriate balance between
employment and academic load. University policy urges students employed more
than 20 hours a week to take a part-time academic load (less than 12 hours).
Students employed 40 hours a week should attempt no more than 6 hours.
Students whose workload exceeds these limits will not receive consideration
from the University for problems arising from the pressures of employment and
academic load. Please see section on  "Academic Load" in the University
catalog.  
  
**Office hours:** Please come see me during my office hours anytime. You don't
have to have a particular reason for coming; you are welcome to just drop by.
Sometimes I am called away to meetings during my office hours. I'll put a note
on my door when such an event happens. If you are busy during the hours I've
listed, call me or see me for an appointment.  
____________________________________________________

Last day to add classes 8 February  
Last day to drop classes with no tuition liability 1 February  
Last day to drop classes without dean's permission 26 February  
Incomplete work from Fall must be submitted to instructor 2 April

**Folklore activities in the Metro Area:**  
  
Washington DC houses more folklorists than any other part of the country, so
there are a wealth of folklore events--lectures, workshops, exhibits,
festivals, fieldtrips, dances, singings, storytellings--throughout the year
here sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, the National Endowment for the
Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Council for the
Traditional Arts, the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress,
many local libraries, and others.  
See my web site for links to many of the opportunities listed here.  
  
Every summer during the last week of June and the first week of July, the
Smithsonian sponsors its **Festival of American Folklife** on the Mall in DC.
One of the best folklife festivals in the nation, this events brings together
traditional performers from across the United States with those from at least
one other nation.  
  
The **Folklore Society of Greater Washington** sponsors many events by both
traditional and revivalist performers--dances several nights a week (square,
contra, and international), song and storytelling concerts, gospel sings,
sacred harp sings, and story and song-swapping evenings. They host weekend
get-a-ways filled with singing, dancing, and storytelling. During the third
weekend in January and the first weekend in June, they host folk festivals
that feature traditional and revival performers. To join the Society and get a
monthly newsletter with a list of all local events and/or to get a listing of
events coming up, call the Folklore Society of Greater Washington Hotline at
703-281-2228.  
  
The **Virginia Folklore Society** and the **Mid-Atlantic Folklife
Association** meet once a year. Here, folklore scholars, students, and those
interested in folklore gather to give papers on their research, see new
folklore films, talk about what's new in folklore, and enjoy each other's
company--often over a good meal. VFS meets in late fall; MAFA, in the spring.  
  
The **Northern Virginia Folk Festival** Association sponsors a folk festival
every other year in Arlington, in the spring.  
  
The **Birchmere** in Alexandria brings in many traditional musicians and
musicians who sing in the folk style.  
  
Every Tuesday night, the **Reston Folk Club** meets at the Tortilla Factory
Restaurant for an evening of open mike folk singing and--once a month--invited
guests.  
  
The **Washington Storytellers Theatre** hosts about three performances a
semester, with professional storytellers from across the country. Other
storytelling events are often listed by the _Post_ in their Friday Weekend
section; check the museum and the children's section. Call (202) 291-2170 for
information.  
  
The area is also home to over 55 different ethnic groups. Their festival and
events, neighborhoods, craft stores, restaurants, grocery stores, and churches
are good places to visit.  
  
Other events speak of the folklife of the region--harvest festivals, wine
festivals, oyster festivals. The Post provides a pretty good list in its
Friday Weekend section. See also the posting of events I keep record of on the
**Folklore Bulletin Board** outside the English Department office.  
  
Best wishes for a good semester!

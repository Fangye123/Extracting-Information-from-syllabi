The purpose of this course is two-fold: first, to investigate the social,
political, cultural, and  to some degree  the military history of the Civil
War, by examining both primary and secondary sources. Second, students will
produce a research paper (twenty pages in length) using both primary and
secondary sources, concerning some aspect of the Civil War experience.

The research paper will constitute the major portion of the students grade
(70%). Other assignments, such as primary source research reports, in-class
presentations, and participation in class discussions, will also be
considered. (30%)

I will be available for consultation on all aspects of the course work,
including the readings, the process of researching and writing the term paper,
and in-class presentations. Please feel free to drop in during my regular
office hours, or make additional appointments as necessary.

Written assignments and presentations

> > **

>>

>> 1\. Primary Source Presentation**. All students will be expected to make a
brief, informal presentation on a primary source collection of their choosing.
Please bring in some examples of the source materials and discuss the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the collection. The purpose of this assignment is
(a) to force you to begin working on primary research as quickly as possible,
and (b) to make the class aware of as many primary sources as possible. This
presentation should not take more than 5-8 minutes of class time.

>>

>> **

>>

>> 2\. Term Essay. **The term essay must be based on primary source research.
For appropriate citation and other formatting details, consult the History
Departments Style Sheet or the _Chicago Manual of Style_. MLA style is not
acceptable. The paper should be at least twenty pages long. More detailed
information on requirements, format, etc., is forthcoming.

>>

>> **

>>

>> 3\. In-Class Presentations. **From time to time, I will ask each of you to
discuss, informally, your progress on the paper. At the end of the term, each
student will present her / his findings and arguments. About three-fourths of
the way through the semester, and again at the end of the term, seminar
participants will exchange drafts. You may exchange your papers with anyone
you choose. If you prefer, I will assign reading partners.

>>

>> **

>>

>> 4\. Class Participation.** Each student is expected to be thoroughly
prepared for every class meeting. Students who find that they are not
adequately prepared for the class discussion are welcome to attend, but are
requested to refrain from offering their commentary on the readings under
discussion.

I would also like to call your attention to page 6 of the ISU Student
Handbook, dealing with the problem of intellectual honesty. Please be aware
that I interpret this section rather broadly--in the context of the classroom,
I consider all aspects of student work to be governed by these principles. I
would like to request, therefore, that all verbal and written work submitted
in class, including class discussions on readings, drafts, and presentations,
be drawn from the students own work and readings. Any work judged to fall
outside the standards stated in the student handbook will receive a failing
grade. In the case of the term paper, a failing grade will, of course, result
in a failing grade for the course. If you have any questions about this,
please talk with me.

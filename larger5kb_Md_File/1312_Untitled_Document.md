    This course will survey the conditions of material life and the changing social and economic relations in medieval Europe
    with reference to the comparative context of contemporary Islamic, Chinese, and central Asian experiences. Subject covers
    the emergence and decline of feudal institutions, the transformation of peasant agriculture, living standards and the course
    of epidemic disease, and the ebb and flow of long-distance trade across the Eurasian system. Particular emphasis will be placed 
    on the study of those factors, both institutional and technological, which have contributed to the emergence of capitalist
    organization and economic growth in western Europe in contrast to the trajectories followed by the other major medieval 
    economies. 
    
    This course has a scheduled three hour final exam. In addition, each student will be expected to write two very short
    (1, or no more than 2, pages each) discussion papers, and three substantive essays (6 pages each) over the course 
    of the term. The discussion papers will be due on February 20 and March 20, and the longer essays will be due on March
    11, April 8, and May 6. The discussion papers should pertain to the reading assigned for the week they are due. Students
    will be asked to write their first essay on a common assigned topic which will expan on their first discussion paper. The last 
    two essays will be on topics of the student's choosing and can be organized in several different ways. Students should
    experiment with more than one form in fulfillment of the requirements for the course. Possible points of departure include: 
    a narrowly focused analysis of a primary source, either from the syllabus or of related interest; a methodological or 
    historiographical discussion of one of the secondary readings on the syllabus; or a thematic discussion which draws on more
    than one source to answer any given historical question. 
    
    _**No internet sources should be consulted for your papers, other than those which are either primary source collections, or are
    academically refereed sites.**_ **** If you are unsure about a site, please consult me prior to using it. If used, all internet sources must be
    properly footnoted and cited in your bibliography at the end of your paper just as for any other type of source. Plagerism form any
    kind of source will not be tolerated. Cheating earns an automatic F (0%) for the assignment. Moreover, all cases of cheating will be 
    reported to the COD for their consideration of the appropriate disciplinary action to take with the student involved. If you are unsure
    what plagerism is please see the [MIT Online Writing Communication Center](http://web.mit.edu/writing/) and follow the Citing and Using Sources link. If you are
    still uncertain, please see me.
    
    Grading:			
    20% for each paper---total of 60%
    5%   for the two discussion papers
    20% for final exam
    15% for class participation--demonstrating mastery of the assigned readings
    
    Late Paper and Unexcused Absence Policy:
    			Late papers will be accepted without penalty in the case of a medical emergency or some other type of
    			emergency which has been brought to my attention in advance. Otherwise, late papers will be graded down
    			5% points for each day they are late. Students are expected to attend every class. Two unexcused absences
    			will be permitted without penalty. However, each unexcused absence above two will result in your final grade
    			being lowered by 2% points. If you know in advance that you must travel during the week for professional 
    			reasons, please see me as soon as possible so that we can make appropriate arrangements.

_Course Description:_  
This course will explore the political, economic and social roles of women in
Europe from the Renaissance to the French Revolution. We will examine European
women's roles as sovereigns and  scholars, witches and prostitutes, nobles,
artisans, and peasants. Topics will include women's political power and
participation, economic roles, marriage and sexuality, and their changing
status in law and in the state in early-modern Europe.  Course materials will
include primary source readings written by women in the early modern period,
films, art, and law codes.

_Course Requirements:_  
Coursework is focused on learning to analyze primary documents and cultural
artifacts in light of the social, economic, and political history of the age.
To this end, there will be no exams in the course, but two short analytical
papers and one longer research paper. Students are encouraged to use the Web
to search for primary source documents and museum sites that supplement
materials available in Lauinger Library; a list of history and art Web sites
will be provided. Each student will also give a short class presentation on a
topic of their choice during the semester, and class participation in
discussion throughout the semester will be a significant portion of your
grade.

Paper 1:  15%  5-6 pages  
Paper 2:  20% 5-6   pages

Paper Topics Paper 2:  

The paper should be 5-7  pages, double-spaced; the due date is Thursday, April
8.

 Using _The Burgermeister's Daughter_ and _Gluckl of Hameln_ (and any other
readings you like), discuss one of the following topics:

1.  The family was a key social structure in early-modern Europe, and one that determined much of an individual's chances for survival or success.  Discuss the ways in which the family as an institution provided both opportunities for and limitations on women.

2.  Throughout their lives, women were involved with law and the courts in early modern states.  Discuss their involvement with legal instruments like marriage contracts, business contracts, inheritances, religious laws, etc.  To what extent could they maneuver within the law to achieve their own ends?         Choose one of the following.  Papers should be 5-6 pages, typed, double-spaced.  No outside research is necessary.   
    
1.  Discuss whether women in the nobility, the middle classes, or the peasantry seemed to have more independence or control over their lives in early modern Europe.  You may want choose two or three main areas, like economic or work options, ability to exercise political authority, education, etc. 

2.  Using _The Paston Letters_ as a touchstone, describe how Margaret Paston or her female relatives exercised power within the family or the larger community, and how they were also limited by their roles.

**ATTENDANCE:**

Students are required to attend class on a regular basis; students that miss
more than **SIX classes** may be dropped from the course by the instructor.
Students should attend class punctually; those students that participate
actively in classroom discussions will be looked upon more favorably during
the final grade evaluation. Remember, it is the student's responsibility to
contact the instructor if he/she can not longer attend classes.



NOTE: _**Please SILENCE all beepers and phones.**_ _**Food, drinks, and
tobacco products are prohibited in the classroom.**_



  
_**QUIZZES:**_

Expect a quiz on a weekly basis. Quizzes will usually be given at the
beginning of the class period based on the day's reading assignment. If you
leave class early on a quiz day, your quiz will not be recorded. **THERE ARE
NO QUIZ MAKE-UPS**. The good news is that the lowest two quiz grades are
dropped. (A missed quiz is a low quiz grade.)  

_**CLASS PARTICIPATION:**_

This class is not a lecture formatted one, where your writing hand need
massage therapy at the end of the period. As an instructor, I want to listen
to what you have learned AND think about the subject matter and readings.
Education is a life-long process and I'm interested in learning from you too.

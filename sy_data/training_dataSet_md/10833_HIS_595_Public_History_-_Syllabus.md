**Catalog Description**  
A comprehensive treatment of the role of history as a discipline, and of the
ways in which the historian's skills and insights transfer to a broad range of
professions outside academia. It is especially recommended as a foundation
course for more specialized study in oral history, museum studies, historic
interpretation, and historic preservation.

* * *

**Instructor's Comments  
** The course combines lectures, discussion of assigned readings, field trips,
and student projects to introduce the field of public history. It will begin
with an investigation of the historical development of American thinking about
the past and its commemoration and public presentation. Then it will introduce
each of the major subfields within public history and conclude with an
overview of the current state of the field and the prospects for its short-
term future.

     TERM ASSIGNMENTS**

Each student will complete a public history project during the semester,
either individually or as part of team. The project should be chosen after
discussion with the instructor and must be approved by the instructor.
Conferences to discuss projects will be scheduled during the first week of the
semester. Projects done in cooperation with historical agencies or
organizations are highly recommended. The project chosen should reflect the
individual interests and career goals of the student. It should reflect
substantive reading and research in a variety of sources. Interviews and site
visits should be used when appropriate.

**OTHER ASSIGNMENTS**

1\. Journal of all field trips. Journal entry should discuss what was done on
the trip and evaluate the trip as a learning experience.

2\. Clippings of news articles relevant to public history. Students will
collect stories from the news media on public history topics. Material should
be from newspapers, general interest news magazines ( _Time_ , _Newsweek_ ,
_US News,_ etc.) **not** from history journals or historical magazines.

3\. Each student will visit ten public history-related web sites and write a
brief (1-2 page) review of each.  
Students may wish to participate in the Public History Listserve H-PUBLIC to
acquaint themselves with current professional issues, conferences, and other
opportunities. To subscribe send a message to LISTSERV@H-NET.MSU.EDU and, in
the text of your message (not the subject line), write:  
SUBSCRIBE H-PUBLIC firstname lastname, university or other affiliation

Those taking the course for graduate credit

4\. Select one of the historic sites critiqued in James W.Loewen, _Lies Across
America._ Assess the substance of Loewen's criticisms of the interpretation at
the site and whether they are accurate and fair. If at all possible visit the
site.

ACADEMIC HONESTY

It is assumed and expected that all students will present only their own work
on exams, the term paper, and any other assignment. Any student caught
cheating will fail the course and al such incidents will be referred to
appropriate University officials for further action, including expulsion from
the University. Plagiarism, i.e. copying material verbatim (i.e. word-for-
word) without attribution is included in the definition of cheating. All
students should become familiar with the College of Humanistic Studies policy
on academic honesty.

The policies of the College of Humanistic Studies on Academic Integrity and
Plagiarism and the College's Principles of Academic Conduct will be followed.

* * *

ATTENDANCE POLICY

Regular class attendance, including attending the entire class, is expected of
all students. Failure to attend class and to be prepared for class discussion
will make it very difficult to pass the course. If you miss class it is your
responsibility to get notes from someone else.

Students are responsible for any changes in the course schedule, including the
date, time, or method of examinations announced in class. Absence when a
change was announced will not be accepted as an excuse for missing an
examination or a class activity.

**III. Objectives of the Course **

If you are a history major, I urge you to consult p. 122 of the 2000-2001
_Lander University Catalog_ for the objectives of the history program.   If
you are taking the course to satisfy the Global Issues/Non-Western Studies
requirement in General Education, the most relevant objectives for this course
are ( _Lander University Catalog_ , pp 58-59):  
  
\--to compare and debate conflicting interpretation of information;  
\--to write and speak standard English; to understand a second language (in
this course to  
  demonstrate the ability to learn and to utilize words and expressions from a
second language  
   when appropriate);  
\--to examine diverse cultures and societies; to understand the impact of such
matters as class,  
    race, sex, heredity, religion and economic status on ideas, practices, and principles; to  
    recognize that ignorance an intolerance of the ways of others contributed to past and present  
    cultural conflicts;  
\--to recognize that the actions of individuals and groups have the power to
effect social change;  
\--to understand how our ideas and institutions as well as our problems have
their roots in the  
   experiences of the past; to perceive the continuity of human experience as
well as its diversity.  
  
There is, of course, a great deal of overlap of the objectives for history
majors and for general education students.  
  
**IV. Course Content**  
  
During the 1980's there was a heated political debate on the appropriate
United States response to revolutions then occurring in Nicaragua and El
Salvador, two small Central American countries where Marxist revolutionaries
threatened established oligarchies and North American interests.   Many
_estadunidenses_ (citizens of the United States as opposed to citizens of
other American countries such as Mexico) were concerned about the presence of
Soviet influence in a region which we considered to be our special sphere of
influence, or as some have put it, the  "backyard."  Much of the reaction
stemmed from our experience with Castro's Revolution in Cuba in the 1960's,
with earlier upheavals in Central America, and with Mexico's massive
revolution of 1910-1940.  Two things were often lost in the debate. First,
revolutionaries and reformers in the region had agendas of their own which had
nothing to do with the Cold War concerns of the U.S.  Second, a long history
of U.S. involvement, dating from the mid-nineteenth century, complicated U.S.
relations with its neighbors to the south.  
  
The goal of this course is to understand the history of our southern neighbors
from their perspective, a perspective that rebels against the idea of being in
somebody else's "backyard."  We will focus on three major revolutions in the
region, Mexico from 1910 to 1940, Cuba in the 1960's and Nicaragua in the
1980's, with briefer exploration of events in countries like Guatemala and El
Salvador.

  
**V. Teaching Strategies Used**  
  
Since enrollment in this summer session will be limited, I want to conduct an
informal class, generating as much class discussion and interaction as
possible.   I hope a lot of discussion will result from the large amount of
audio-visual material that exists for the course.  At the same time, I will
use an informal mode of lecture to narrate key events, establish chronological
framework and explain key concepts.  To be successful in the course and to be
able to contribute to the class discussion, it will still be necessary for you
to read assignments and come to class prepared to offer informed questions and
opinions.

**VI. Evaluation **

**Ten percent of ** your grade will be based on a map quiz.  You may take the
quiz three times.  The highest grade will count.

There will be two in-class exams and a grade for class participation.  Of
these three grades, the lowest will be dropped and the remaining two will each
weigh thirty percent in computing the final grade.

A final in-class examination will be given and will weigh thirty percent.
This grade may not be dropped.

All in-class examinations will consist of short identification and definition
items, paragraph length identification/discussion items, and an essay.  
  
The following scale will be used for averaging: 0-59=F; 60-69=D;
70-79=C;80-89=B and 90-100=A.  
  
Attendance and promptness are expected.  If you miss class twice (six hours of
work), I will penalize your final grade one letter for each additional
absence. I reserve the right to count tardiness and leaving class early as
absences if these behaviors become a habit.

If there is a reason why you will need to come late or dismiss yourself during
class, please let me know in advance.

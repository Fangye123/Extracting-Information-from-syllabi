>>>> ![](2.gif)Supplementary note on names: The other TAs for this class are
Diana Laulainen-Schein and Anne Herman.  There are a number of Annes in this
department, so if you call or come by 609 looking for me, remember my last
name to prevent confusion and find the correct voice-mail extension.  E-mail
is the best way to contact me.

>>>>

>>>> ![](2.gif)Important!!--I reserve the right to revise this syllabus during
the quarter if revision is necessary.  It is the student's responsibility to
read and follow this syllabus and Professor Altholz's syllabus.  The student
is also responsible for all information distributed in lecture and in the
sections and for any changes made to the syllabi.  All changes will be
announced in the discussion sections.  I also reserve the right to use
exercises and assignments not listed on this syllabus, such as pop quizzes, if
they are necessary, in my opinion, to stimulate discussion.

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)Books

>>>>

>>>> Text:  Roberts, Clayton and David Roberts.  A History of England:  Volume
I: Prehistory to 1714.  3rd. ed.  1991\.  
>  Document Reader:  Blakeley, Brian L. and Jacquelin Collins.  Documents in
British History:  Volume I:  Early Times to 1714.  2nd ed. 1993.

>>>>

>>>> On Reserve in Wilson Library:  Two articles will be on reserve for
sections 2 and 5 in Wilson Library.  The reserve desk is in the basement to
your right past the photocopiers as you enter.  Look up the class number
(3151) in the reserve card catalog in front of the desk.  You will know which
items you want because they will have my name and the section numbers on the
cards.

>>>>

>>>> Please don't feel embarrassed to come to my office hours and ask for help
in reading these books and articles.  They will be a new type of reading for
many of you, especially the document reader, and you may feel that you are not
reading correctly or remembering the right things.

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)Course Requirements

>>>>

>>>> You are required to attend all lectures (3 per week) and all discussion
section meetings for which you are enrolled (1 per week).  You are responsible
for completing 2 essay examinations, all reading assignments, several writing
assignments listed below, and other assignments, such as a map quiz.

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)University Policies

>>>>

>>>> On the last page of this syllabus, I have included a copy of University
and CLA policies.  I expect each student to read and understand these
policies.  If you have any questions regarding them, it is your responsibility
to see me early in the quarter.  If you need to miss class for religious
reasons or for University sponsored activities, such as sports, you must meet
with me in advance and make arrangements for making up missed work.  Also, if
you have any concerns about your ability to perform in this course, see me
during office hours early in the quarter.

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)Grade Calculation

>>>>

>>>> I grade on a 1000 point system to make things easier for my math-hating
brain.  That means I will grade the midterm as worth 250 points and the final
as worth 500 points. You will get a number of points over the total number
possible.  For example, your midterm grade might look like this:  199/250  B-.
Divide 199 by 250 to get your percentage.  In this case you get .796 or 79.6%.
I round this up to 80% thus coming up with a B-.

>>>>

>>>>  Midterm Exam--25%  
>   Final Exam--50%  
>   Discussion Section Work--25%  
>  
>>>>

>>>> A=94% or above  
>  A- = 90-93%  
>  B+=87-89%  
>  B=84-86%  
>  B- =80-83%  
>  C+=77-79%  | C= 74-76%  
>  C- =70-73%  
>  D+=67-69%  
>  D=60-66%  
>  (no D- in the U's system)  
>  F=59% or below  
>>>> ---|---  
>>>>  
>>>> ### ![](2.gif)Section Grades

>>>>

>>>> Since your section is worth 25% of your total grade, it is worth 250
points.  These points break down as follows:

>>>>

>>>> In-class writings:  6 @ 15 points each for a total of 90 points.  
>  Map Quiz:  10 points  
>  Article Quiz:  10 points  
>  Article Assignment 1:  45 points  
>  Article Review:  75 points  
>  Participation:  20 points

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)Participation

>>>>

>>>> Amorphous participation grades often confuse students, but they give the
grader a flexible place to account for improvement over the quarter and to
give credit for adding to discussion.  To get an A on your class discussion,
do the following:

>>>>

>>>> 1\. show up  
>  2\. add to discussion  
>  3\. don't read irrelevent stuff, such as the Daily, during class  
>  4\. listen attentively  
>  5\. turn in review questions for exams

>>>>

>>>> If you find you are having trouble adding to large group discussions,
make sure you participate actively in the small groups.  You might also write
down questions you have about the discussion and ask them.  Asking question IS
participation.  Don't direct all questions at me.  Ask everyone else too.  If
you are shy and have trouble speaking off the top of your head, offer to act
as a secretary for a small group.  Write down your group's ideas and present
them to the class.  It is easier to read something than make it up as you go
along.  This may seem difficult, but the more you speak up, the less shy you
will be.  You don't have to talk every day to get an A but you do have to
discuss actively in at least half of the 10 section meetings.  That also means
that the talkative people need to let everyone have a chance to get a word in.  
>  Improvement:  Showing improvement over the quarter will also help your
section grade.

>>>>

>>>> ![](2.gif)**Incompletes:  ** Except in cases of the student's extreme
illness or injury, no incompletes will be granted.  Any ill or injured student
should provide documentation to me for consideration.

>>>>

>>>> ![](2.gif)**Writing Assignments:**   Historians communicate through
writing.  Students in this course must use standard English.  Standardization
ensures that all readers of English, no matters where they are from, will be
able to understand your writing and thus your ideas.  You, as a student in
this class, must follow the guidelines and practices of the profession.

>>>>

>>>> The article assignments are due at the beginning of your section.
Writing assignments done as homework must be typed, double-spaced, in a 10 or
12 point font.  Margins should be one inch on left, right, top, and bottom.
Do not use wide margins or large fonts to make up for lack of content.  All
assignments will be explained in section before they are due.

>>>>

>>>> ![](2.gif)**Writing Tutor:  ** The history department has a writing tutor
whose job is to help history students with their paper assignments.  This
quarter our tutor is Chris Allan:

>>>>

>>>> Office: 1148 Social Sciences  
>  Phone: 625-1083  
>  E-mail: [alla0036@tc.umn.edu](mailto:alla0036@tc.umn.edu) |

>>>>

>>>> Office Hours:  
>  Monday: 8-11am, 1-4pm  
>  Tuesday and Wenesday: 10am-1pm  
>  Thursday: 8-11am  
>>>> ---|---  
>>>>  
>>>> You should set up appointments in advance to see Chris.  He may want you
to turn in your paper a couple of days before your appointment so he has a
chance to read it and comment on it.  Therefore, you should not procrastinate.
At crunch times, many other students will also want to see Chris.  
>  Please remember that it is NOT the history writing tutor's job to proofread
your papers.  He is there to help you with organization, style, and
specifically, historical writing.  If you need or want more help, there is a
writing lab in Lind Hall on the East Bank.

>>>>

>>>> ![](2.gif)**Late Work:**   If you turn in a paper one day late, you
forfeit one letter grade.  The second day forfeits three letter grades.  After
the second day, do not turn in the assignment.  I will not grade it.  I use
this policy because students who turn assignments in late often make it a
habit and I am very busy.  I schedule time to grade and cannot reschedule for
late work.

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)Discussion of the readings

>>>>

>>>> We will not discuss all of the readings in section.  We don't have time.
You are responsible for the information even if we don't cover it in class.
Do not count on the section to simply review lecture and book material.  I
will be glad to help you with analytical questions or factual questions about
information not covered clearly in the book.  I know there are always some
things that textbooks do not explain well.

>>>>

>>>> ![](2.gif)**Office Hours:** One of the most frequent comments TAs make is
"nobody comes to see me during office hours."  My hours are listed at the
beginning of this syllabus.  During these times I am in my office (609 Social
Sciences) and available to help you.  You may drop in or make an appointment.
Come and ask questions about anything you don't understand or want some
feedback on:  the readings, an assignment, British history in general, other
books to read if you are interested in continuing your study of the subject,
etc.  I would like to have you all come in and talk with me so I know what you
think about your performance in the course, but I don't want to make this a
formal requirement.  Just remember, your tuition money is paying for my time
and you should feel free to take advantage of the help I can give during these
hours.  If you have schedule conflicts and cannot come to the hours I have set
aside, e-mail me and I will make an appointment with you at a more convenient
time.

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)Assignments

>>>>

>>>> See the handouts for guidelines on writing the IDs, in-class writings,
and article assignments.  
>  The assignments are listed under the week they are DUE.

>>>>

>>>> ### ![](2.gif)IDs

>>>>

>>>> These are important terms from your reading.  I cannot guarantee that
these will appear on the exam or that I found all potential IDs.  If you find
others, share them with the class.  In any event, knowing these will help you
learn the history and will be useful on essay questions. IMPORTANT:  Many of
the IDs listed on one week will reappear in later readings.  Some will be
important for almost all of the quarter.  Add to your ID answers as your
complete more reading.  The answers to historical significance and perhaps
even the basic definition of who/what may change over time.

>>>>

>>>> I have only listed IDs for the first few weeks.  After that you will be
responsible for finding them yourself.  I know that they can be hard to pick
out of the text.  That is why I have provided examples for a few weeks.  Look
carefully at the types of terms that I chose and what the text has to say
about them.  Again, I may not have chosen exactly what Prof. Altholz would and
I have not included anything from the lectures.  Listen carefully to what the
professor emphasizes.

through the Anglo-Saxon period?  In other words, how have invasions and
conquest influenced political, economic, social, cultural, and religious
developments?

>>>>

>>>> This is the type of broad question you are likely to see on the midterm
or final.  In fact, on the exam, you might not get the second sentence which
gives you hints on how to organize your answer.  You might only get the first
question and the order: Discuss.  You need to come up with a thesis and an
organization for your answer before you start writing.

Papacy was the King's desire, arising at first from political considerations
and then from Henry's infatuation with Anne Boleyn, to be divorced from Queen
Catherine." (133)  "[However,] many factors combined to make the English
Reformation exceedingly complex.  England's insularity, her distance from
Rome, and her increasing concern for her national interest had long rendered
her orthodoxy questionable." (131)  Raymond Phineas Stearns, The Pageant of
Europe, pp. 131, 133.

###  Grading:

Your final grade in the course will be determined as follows: each test will
count as one-fourth and the final examination will count as one-fourth. The
remaining fourth of the grade will consist of the weekly quizzes and the map
quizzes (each counts as three regular quizzes) which when combined will
constitute fifteen percent (l5%) of the final grade. That grade will be added
to the grade for the research paper (five percent, 5%), and five percent for
professional development [class attendance, promptness in getting to class,
attentiveness, classroom manners], to make up the final quarter of your grade
for the course.

Return to Table of Contents

###  Attendance Policy:

Students will find it exceedingly difficult to succeed in this class unless
they attend with regularity. However, your instructor does not believe in
artificially penalizing students for failing to attend class by lowering their
grades. On the other hand, I begin classes promptly and have no patience with
students who are tardy. Therefore I reserve the right to deduct points from
the final grade of a student who is late for class! Also I have a closed mind
on absences from tests. Make-ups will be given only when students have a valid
reason for the absence. In some cases students may be required to write an
additional research paper in addition to taking a make-up test.

"An educated man must have a certain minimum of general knowledge. Even if he
knows little about science and cannot add or substract, he must have heard of
Mendel and Kepler. Even if he is tone deaf he must know something about
Debussy and Verdi; even if he is a pure sociologist he must be aware of Circe
and the Minotaur, of Kant and Montaign, of Titus Oates and Tiberius Gracchus."

####  Term Paper Requirements

Students should NOT use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do NOT use parenthetical notes!! Only footnotes and endnotes wi ll be
acceptable! Please consult Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_. 6th ed.

Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a termpaper.

Footnoting a book:      **1 Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London:
George Allen and Unwin, l938), 33.**

  


If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,      **2 Ibid., 37.** (Note that Ibid. is not underlined)

If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,      **17 Waley, _The Analects_ , 130.**

Footnoting a multi-volume work:      **3 Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ ,
vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization_ , ed. John
W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, l986), 402.**

####  PLAGIARISM:

Students should be reminded that the use of an author's ideas in a student
paper without giving proper credit to the author constitutes plagiarism.
Likewise the use of an author's words without placing those words in quotation
marks and providing proper citation is plagiarism. Students sometimes believe
that by changing an occasional word or two or even three in a sentence or
paragraph, they are avoiding plagiarism. This is not the case! The information
and ideas taken from a source must be re-formed into your own words! And after
re-forming it into your own words, you must use a footnote or endnote giving
proper credit to the author.

If your instructor suspects intentional or unintentional plagiarism, your
paper will be returned ungraded and you will be asked to bring your sources to
his office to verify the scholarship.

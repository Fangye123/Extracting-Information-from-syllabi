**Course Description:**  
An introduction to the process of research and development in computer
science. Includes an overview of research methodology, examination of the
procedures necessary to identify a feasible research project, and an
introduction to the literature search process. The experience will involve the
software engineering of a programming solution to a client's problem, or the
completion of a research project in a topic area of computer science following
the traditional scientific method.

**Course Prerequisites:**  
For COSC 4247: Senior standing, COSC 3339, and MATH 2320 or 3334.  
For CISC 4247: Senior standing, CISC 3339, BUSI 2305, and BUSI 2106.  
Additionally, students enrolling in this course will be expected to have
satisfied all six modules of the Computer Competency Requirement (CCR). All
Undergraduate and New College students who entered St. Edward's University
under the Fall 1999 catalog and later are required to satisfy the CCR. The CCR
modules comprise Introduction to Computers, Introduction to Email,
Introduction to Netscape and the World Wide Web, Basic Library Research,
Introduction to Word Processing, and Introduction to Spreadsheets. Students
must satisfactorily complete a web-based test over each module in order to
fulfill this requirement. For more information about the Computer Competency
Requirement, go to:
[www.stedwards.edu/it_dept/competency](http://www.stedwards.edu/it_dept/competency)
or call 464-8816.

**Required Texts:**  
_Writing for Computer Science_ , by Justin Zobel, Springer.

**Requirements:**

  1. Attend and actively participate in all classes (for the entire class period).
  2. Complete all assignments and turn in all documentation in a timely manner. One of the most important aspects of this course is meeting established deadlines, even as it is in real life. To emphasize the importance of this, prior to the official drop deadline, students who fail to submit the required work within 48 hours of the specified deadline may be issued a "WA" grade and withdrawn from the course. If a WA grade is not assigned (and the student does not withdraw from the class), students who fail to submit required documentation, collect experimental data, and/or demonstrate a satisfactorily completed project within a timely manner will be assigned a grade of "D" or "F". If you are too busy to complete the course requirements within the specified deadlines, it may be in your best interest to withdraw from the class. No assignments or documentation will be accepted after the last day of classes for the Fall semester - NO exceptions.
  3. Complete two quizzes and a final examination.
  4. Prepare in advance for all class sessions by reading and studying the text.
  5. Perform all work in a timely manner and inform the instructor IMMEDIATELY if a problem arises.
  6. Seek assistance and ask questions about course material or course requirements from the instructor as necessary. You are responsible for all material presented in class.

**Assignments and Documentation:**  
In order to successfully complete the course you will turn in the following
items:

  * Project Proposal - Due: 6/4
  * Hypothesis - Due: 6/13
  * Experimental Design - Due: 6/27
  * Data Presentation & Analysis - Due: 8/6
  * Project Notebook - random and unannounced dates (bring your notebook to EVERY class)

The data presentation and analysis part of your grade will be affected by the
"degree of difficulty" given to your project during the "project proposal"
phase of your project. For more information about the required documentation,
please click on the "Documentation" link on the class web-site.

**Presentation:**  
During the last two weeks of class you will **** give an oral presentation
describing your project. You will also prepare a web based presentational
complement to your oral presentation. This web based component will feature an
abstract of your project.

**Method of Determining Final Course Grade:** Project Proposal | 10%  
---|---  
Hypothesis | 15%  
Experimental Design | 20%  
Data Presentation & Analysis | 25%  
Web-Based Presentation (includes abstract) | 10%  
Oral Presentation (given in class) | 5%  
Class Participation | 5%  
Project Notebook | 10%  
  
**Academic Honesty:**  
In its broadest sense, academic dishonesty is defined as representing some
other person's work as your own.  Students are expected to do their OWN work
on all exams and assignments.  When evidence of academic dishonesty exists,
all those involved may receive an "F" for the course.

**Absences and Withdrawal:**  
Although the instructor has the prerogative to withdraw students for excessive
absences, lack of progress, or academic dishonesty he is under no obligation
to do so. It is the responsibility of the student and _not_ the responsibility
of the instructor to initiate all withdrawal proceedings. If the student fails
to complete the course work and/or has excessive absences a grade of "F" will
normally be assigned.  
According to the College calendar, June 3, 2002 is the last day for an
unrecorded drop or withdrawal and July 19, 2002 is the last day to withdraw
and receive a grade of "W".

**Learning Considerations:**  
If you have a certified learning disability that requires special
consideration with respect to your class performance, please inform the
instructor privately of any special needs you may have before the second class
day. You will also need to provide documentation of your disability to Student
Disability Services.  


**Required Research Project Elements**  
All Research Projects must demonstrably satisfy ALL the required elements
listed here. Projects that do not meet all these criteria will not be
acceptable for this course. Naturally, all projects must be directly related
to the computer sciences majors, and be of such a nature that they would be
nearly impossible for anyone other than a computer sciences major to do in the
time allotted, for some client.

  1. The project must be an individual effort, with all components, from start to finish, completed solely by the student. This includes all the planning, experimental design, data collection, data display, and documentation. Group efforts will not be permitted.
  2. The project must be designed utilizing only equipment and other resources currently available to the client.
  3. If the project is work-related, the student's manager must sign a statement guaranteeing support for the project from start to finish. The manager MUST guarantee that support will NOT be withdrawn for any reason. The manager must also agree to formally evaluate the project.
  4. If the project is work-related, the student MUST be able to share the substance of the work with the instructor, including a discussion of the results, conclusions, and subsequent changes made as a result of the knowledge gained, and discuss the work freely at the Senior Seminar Symposium scheduled for early April, 2003.
  5. The project must be such that data can be obtained and an analysis made no later than mid-November.
  6. The project should require new knowledge and/or skills gained via independent learning on the part of the student. The nature of the new knowledge and/or skills and the strategy for learning this material must be specified.
  7. Students may not be their own client (you may not work for yourself).

OVERALL STATEMENT

            Democracy means many things, but at the core of its meaning is a system of rule in which the citizenry is the ultimate sovereign.  Policies adopted and implemented by governmental authorities ought to be responsive to the preferences of that citizenry.  And the preferences of each citizen ought to be weighed equally.  If this is to happen, there must be some set of mechanisms or procedures whereby the preferences of citizens are expressed, aggregated, and communicated to governing decision-makers, and there must be some set of incentives that lead the decision-makers to be responsive to these preferences.  Put another way, there must be some way in which citizens can communicate their preferences to rulers and pressure them to respond.  This is a basic issue in democracy.

            The standard mechanism for communicating preferences to decision making elites and providing incentives for compliance is a system of elections and representative government.  Citizen voices are expressed through votes; governing elites respond because of the incentive of election and reelection.  Voting and elections represent a remarkable invention whereby the very varied preferences of a multitude of citizens can be standardized and aggregated.  But votes communicate only limited information about citizen preferences.  Democratic communication is supplemented by many other mechanisms: participation by activist citizens in campaigns and for political causes (participation through giving of their time and effort or by giving money); organized interest groups, public opinion polls; direct policy making through referendums; etc.  These differ in their information carrying capacity, in their bias toward one set of citizens or another, and in the inducements that they convey for response on the part of ruling elites. 

            This course will compare these  mechanisms for citizen control in terms of: the nature of the information they convey, the bias in terms of whose preferences are communicated, and the incentives for compliance associated with each mechanism.

            Some features of the course include:

            SUBSTANTIVE FOCUS: The course will trace the communication of citizen preferences from their micro-origins in the preferences of individual citizens, through the processes of aggregation and communication, to consider the outcomes that result from the processes in terms of whose preferences receive more or less effective communication.  Most of the material will be taken from studies of American politics and society, in part to give this broad ranging course a focus and in part because the best data and analysis exist about American politics.  However, comparisions of these processes under different structural conditions -- i.e., in different countries with different party and organizational systems -- will be made where appropriate.

            NORMATIVE THEORY, POSITIVE THEORY, AND EMPIRICAL SOCIAL SCIENCE:  The course will attempt to link all three.  We will consider various normative writings as to the nature of democracy, representation, and the role of the citizen; various positive theories of individual behavior and  preference aggregation; and juxtapose them against the systematic empirical studies of how citizens actually behave. 

            METHODOLOGIES: The course will compare various methods for observing and analyzing citizen preferences.  This methodological component is intimately related to the substantive issue of the course.  The set of preferences in the public is not immediately apparent. What they look like depends on the method used to observe them.  The students will learn how social scientists try to make complex realities orderly and measureable -- and what is gained and lost in that operation.  The methodological component will also deal with the ways in which political actors "read" the public. 

            Major attention will be paid to the various ways in which social scientists and political elites explain and interpret the vote as well as to the kinds of information provided by systematic surveys of the public.  The main point to be made here is that the substantive impact of the citizenry is mediated by the methods used to observe it.

            ASSIGNMENTS AND STRUCTURE: There will be two lectures and one discussion section each week.  There will be an hour exam, one paper due at the end of the term, and a final.

            _Paper_ :  The paper will focus on an example of citizen preference expression; on an empirical example of citizen political "voice".  This means activity by a group of citizens, an organization speaking for citizens, or unorganized individuals trying to influence the activity of governing elites.  The paper should connect the generalizations of the course to the specific example.  The course deals with many general aspects of the democratic process.  The paper need not cover all of them.  For instance we will consider the nature of citizen beliefs or  preferences: how they organize the confusion of political into meaningful patterns.  A paper could focus on some group and their beliefs and preferences.  The course also deals with the ways citizens communicate their preferences.  And it deals with the way preference expression is stratified.   Any or all of these general themes might come to play in a paper on a specific example of citizen participation.

            The issues or events used in the example can be current or historical.  Students with the capacity and interest to analyze survey data will have access to various data sets through the Harvard-MIT Data Center in Littauer.  Students will also be encouraged to do field work if their topic warrants it: interviewing activists as to the messages they send or targets of messages about the messages they receive.  Team projects (where several students gather information together -- but write separate papers) will be encouraged. 

            Finding a topic: The example can come from any level of governance:   national politics , local politics, or even politics at Harvard..  It can even refer to world politics (examples might be the protests about the World Trade Organization in Seattle or ethnic groups in the U.S. trying to influence US policy).    It might involve a focus on a particular issue on  the national scene (abortion, welfare, gun control, drunk driving, environment, creationism, taxpayers, the civil rights movement, the gay rights movement) .  Or a local issue (taxes, schools, roads).  Or an issue on campus (student involvement with casual workers, student government, ethnic organizations on campus, etc.)   It can be contemporary (which has the advantage of allowing for interviews or direct observation of meetings etc).  It can be historical.  Students should start rummaging for a topic early.  The best bet might be to "aim little and think big" \-- that is, to find some set of events, some cause, some set of people, that can be looked at quite closely but that then can be analyzed in terms of the more general themes of the course.  Don't analyze the American Revolution or the civil rights movements or the pro-life movement.  Maybe look in your home town -- or around you in Harvard or Cambridge.

            The preparation of the paper will take place in several stages: 

March 7.  Potential paper topics are to be sent to section leaders for
discussion in section that week.  Discussions in section and individually with
section leaders ought to help locate a viable topic.

April 4.  Starting the week of April 4th, papers will be discussed in section.
Students will circulate a one page summary of the topic and the argument by
Tuesday of the week in which they are presenting.  Those presenting early in
the term will not be expected to have as full a proposal as those presenting
later.

             Papers due last day of Reading Period.

            In addition to these student reports which will come later in the semester, the sections will be devoted to discussing the themes of the weeks lectures and readings, with particular topics for emphasis listed in the syllabus.

**I. Description:** History 121 focuses on the history of Latin America from
about 1800 to the present, introducing students to some of the major issues
that have shaped regional politics and society over the past two centuries.
Through readings, written assignments, presentations and discussion, students
will analyze the 19th century quest for political stability and economic
development; the causes and outcomes of the 20th century revolutionary
movements; and the development of authoritarian regimes and democratic
transitions in the late 20th century. In addition, the course will address
both the history of U.S.-Latin American relations and the ways in which
population growth, neoliberalism and current migration patterns are reshaping
regional cultural practices and international relations.  
  
**II. Objectives:** The goals of History 121 are threefold: 1.) to introduce
students to foreign cultures and regional political issues 2.) to develop
critical reading, analytical and writing skills 3.) to help students develop
oral presentation skills through participation in section meetings and through
formal presentation  
  
**III. Methodology:** alternation between lecture and discussion. Lectures
will involve formal presentations by me as well as discussion and
participation of students in class. Readings (primary documents), video
recordings and sound media will give students first hand exposure to how Latin
Americans perceived many of the issues under consideration. The course
encourages students participation in lecture and discussion sections.  
  
**IV. Expectations/Grading Policies:** You are expected to attend class
regularly, to complete readings and to turn in assignments on time. If, for
some reason, you are unable to keep up with the work according to the schedule
you should contact Kris or me as soon as possible to work out a program for
getting you back on track.  
  
If there is something you do not understand or if you have any questions,
please contact me or Kris by phone or email. If we?re not available, leave
messages, and we'll call you back. Communication is essential. Please, please
do not just disappear or go awol.

**VIII. How to perform well in this course** :  
  
_Attendance:_ It is essential that you attend class regularly. For this reason
attendance at lecture and participation in discussion sections is required and
forms part of the final grade. You should purchase a notebook or bring plenty
of paper with you to class so that you can take notes on information provided
through lecture, presentation and review.  
  
_Readings:_ It is recommended that you purchase the books and course packet
that are available. If you choose to purchase only some of these items, I
would recommend that you select the course packet as well as the Keen and
Haynes textbook; however, you are responsible for completing all assigned
readings and must arrange to read those texts you do not purchase at the
W.E.B. DuBois library, where they have been placed on 2 hour reserve.  
  
I recommend that you take notes as you complete the readings. You may want to
underline text you consider to be important and/or take notes in the margins.
However, I would recommend that you also keep a notebook with you and take
notes or outline the author's argument after you have completed the text. This
kind of review will enable you to retain the information longer and to access
it more quickly for the purposes of discussion and debate.  
  
**Writing:** We will discuss writing quite a bit throughout the semester, and
developing and improving writing skills is a goal of this course. However, I
can't overemphasize the importance of two issues:  
* taking notes on the topics about which you will be writing  
* organizing and outlining your argument before sitting down at the computer  
* writing one or more drafts before turning in your final version  
  
**Class participation:** History 121 is an introductory course; there are no
prerequisites, and I anticipate that students will bring a variety of
perspectives on and experiences regarding Latin America to their membership in
this learning community. You are encouraged to bring your questions and
curiosity to lecture and discussion sections. One of the skills we will be
working to develop is  "informed participation." I expect that by the time you
arrive at section meetings on Friday you will have read, analyzed and written
about the texts assigned for that week. This means that in discussion you will
be able to raise critical and informed questions about the topics under
consideration.  
  
Also, keep in mind that because this is a course that draws students from
across the university, participants will bring a variety of skills and
perspectives to the course. I anticipate that students, whether in lecture or
discussion section, will, when engaging in debate or discussion, be respectful
of others' opinions and work to encourage their classmates to be open minded
and tolerant of others' views.

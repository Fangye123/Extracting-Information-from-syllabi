**Schedule of Topics and Readings**

The following schedule is provisional. It suggests topics for each meeting and
coordinates readings with lecture-discussion topics. The __Sources of
Additional Perspectives__ sections are for those who might want to follow up
special lines of interest and for use in getting started on paper topics.
**_Please_** do the readings before the class session for which they are
appropriate if you possibly can. **NOTE:** The readings for this course will
average less than 100 pp./week, although the reading schedule is somewhat
uneven, with the heaviest reading loads at the beginning and toward the end.

**PART I:**  
**INTRODUCTORY MATTERS**

**Meeting 1 -- January 19:**  
Introduction to perspectives in the history of science and to the character
and organization of the course. What are Science and Technology? Why should we
care about definitions?

[Class Meeting Outline](0119.html)

__Handout:__ [Some Definitions of Science](sciencedefinitions.html)

__Common Readings_ : _NONE.

__Sources of Additional Perspectives__ :  
Students with no previous exposure to the history of science might be
interested in looking at some short essays defining the scope of the field. Of
these, T.H. Kuhn's "History of Science" in the most recent _Encyclopedia of
the Social Sciences_ is beautifully clear and concise. Slightly more complex
and comprehensive is John Christie's "The Development of the Historiography of
Science," in R.C. Olby, et.al., _Companion to the History of Modern Science_
(London, 1996). Now outdated, but fascinating for its positivist bent, is
George Sarton's _The Study of the History of Science_. One of the most
entertaining historiographic essays is Joseph Agassiz's "Toward An
Historiography of Science", ( _History and Theory_ , Beiheft 2).

On definitions of science, see "Amicus Curiae Brief of 7 Nobel Laureates... In
the Supreme Court of the United States, October term, 1986", pp. 1-4, 23-26

Idea_ (London, 1988); J.R. Ravetz, "The Varieties of Scientific Experience" in

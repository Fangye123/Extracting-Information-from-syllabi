**Course description:** This course introduces students to the dramatic text
as literature and as a text written for performance. Emphasis will be placed
upon the elements of drama, such as dialogue, character and dramatic
structure, as well as upon the genres of tragedy, comedy and tragicomedy.
Readings will include major plays from Western drama, presented in a trans-
historical approach that juxtaposes modern drama with plays from earlier
periods. Although attention will be paid to the cultural and theatrical
milieux from which each play arose, discussions will concentrate upon
discovering a contemporary critical vision of the work. The class will attend
plays staged in the Oberlin area and view film and video productions of plays
(outside class time).

**Course Requirements:** An important component of the course will be class
participation. As you read, jot down questions and ideas and bring them to
class. **Attendance is required**. It is required that students attend one on-
campus performance and screenings of three videos (listed on the last page of
the syllabus). Groups of students will prepare scenes from plays to be
presented in class. In addition, students must also complete all the written
requirements in order to receive credit for the course, which include two 4-5
page papers, as well as mid-term and final examinations (see Paper Topics).

**Attendance Policy:** It is extremely important that you attend class and be
there on time. Much of our course work occurs during discussions and small
group workshops, and if you miss these, they cannot be made up. If you have
more than three unexcused absences during the semester, your grade will
automatically drop. Excused absences will not count as long as they are not
extensive and work is made up promptly. Absences will be excused if you are
ill or if you have a family emergency or some other grave or extreme
situation. Doctor's notes, etc., are encouraged. You may notify me via e-mail
if you cannot attend at fdorff@oberlin.edu.

    CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
    
    Genetic Programming 1997 Conference (GP-97)
    July 13 - 16 (Sunday - Wednesday), 1997
    Fairchild Auditorium - Stanford  University - Stanford, California
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In cooperation with American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 
    Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), SIGART, and Society for Industrial 
    and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    WWW FOR GP-97:[ http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~koza/gp97.html](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~koza/gp97.html)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE: You are urged to make your housing arrangements as early as possible
    since convenient hotel locations are limited.  Also, if you are driving
    to the Stanford campus, please be aware of parking lot construction in
    the area of Fairchild Auditorium and allow a little extra time 
    (particularly on the first Monday session) to find a parking place.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Genetic programming is an automatic programming technique for evolving 
    computer programs that solve (or approximately solve) problems.  Starting with 
    a primordial ooze of thousands of randomly created computer programs, a 
    population of programs is progressively evolved over many generations using 
    the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest, a sexual recombination 
    operation, and occasional mutation.   
     
    The first annual genetic programming conference in 1996 featured 15 tutorials, 
    2 invited speakers, 3 parallel tracks, 73 papers, and 17 poster papers in 
    proceedings book, and 27 late-breaking papers in a separate book distributed 
    to conference attendees, and 288 attendees.  A description of GP-96 appears in 
    the October 1996 issue of Scientific American 
    (http://www.sciam.com/WEB/1096issue/1096techbus3.html).  This second annual 
    conference in 1997 reflects the rapid growth of this field in which over 600 
    technical papers have been published since 1992.  For August 5, 1996 article 
    in E. E. Times on GP-96 conference and August 12, 1996 article in E. E Times 
    on John Holland's invited speech at GP-96, go to[
    http://www.techweb.com/search/search.html](http://www.techweb.com/search/search.html)
    
    There will be 36 long, 33 short, and 15 poster papers at the Second Annual
    Genetic Programming Conference to be held on July 
    13-16 (Sunday - Wednesday), 1997 at Stanford University.
    In addition, there will be late-breaking papers (published in a separate
    book in mid June after the June 11 deadline for late-breaking papers).
    Topics include, but are not limited to,
    applications of genetic programming, theoretical foundations of 
    genetic programming, implementation issues, technique extensions, cellular 
    encoding, evolvable hardware, evolvable machine language programs, automated 
    evolution of program architecture, evolution and use of mental models, 
    automatic programming of multi-agent strategies, distributed artificial 
    intelligence, auto-parallelization of algorithms, automated circuit synthesis, 
    automatic programming of cellular automata, induction, system identification, 
    control, automated design, data and image compression, image analysis, pattern 
    recognition, molecular biology applications, grammar induction, and 
    parallelization.  Papers describing recent developments are also solicited in 
    the following additional areas: genetic algorithms, classifier systems, 
    evolutionary programming and evolution strategies, artificial life and 
    evolutionary robotics, DNA computing, and evolvable hardware.

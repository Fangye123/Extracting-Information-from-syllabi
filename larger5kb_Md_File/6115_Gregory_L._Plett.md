Invited  
Researcher  |  Invited to UNAM as a summer researcher. Pioneered a
collaborative effort between Stanford University and UNAM to explore common
research interests in adaptive control. Joint research continues.  |  1997

Research  
Assistant  |  Extended the ``adaptive inverse control'' paradigm to allow
constrained control of linear or nonlinear, SISO or MIMO plants. A new
algorithm performs two roles--it adapts a linear or nonlinear adaptive filter
to control the feedforward dynamics of the plant, and it adapts a linear or
nonlinear adaptive filter to cancel system disturbance. This control method
also allows replacing expensive but accurate sensors with ones which are less
expensive but non-ideal. Also discovered methods to improve convergence time
of linear adaptive controllers.  |  1995-  
|  Applied neural network pattern recognition techniques to the problem of
anti-personnel mine detection. Researched novel data pre-processing and post-
processing methods. Investigated data transformation and vector quantization
techniques to improve generalization.  |  1992-95  
|  _Bell Northern Research (now[Nortel](http://www.nortel.com)). Ottawa, ON,

Scientific  
Staff  |  Developed a simulator and conducted simulations to determine the
traffic capacity of several proposed radio standards for cordless telephony.
In particular, established bandwidth requirements and investigated dynamic
channel allocation and call handover strategies for in-building wireless
communication systems. Participated in the design of the enhanced North
American ``CT2'' standard.  |  1986-91

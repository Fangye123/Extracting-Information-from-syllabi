COURSE SYLLABUS

  
  
  

**Description** : This course examines the economic base of the private and
public sectors in the New England region with special emphasis on
Massachusetts and focus on the role policy plays in hindering or promoting
economic growth and equity in a regional context. We will explore the economic
resources of the New England economy, economic theories (there are several) of
the role of government in a market economy, the fiscal situation of the
states, and the revenue and expenditure mechanisms of state and local
governments.

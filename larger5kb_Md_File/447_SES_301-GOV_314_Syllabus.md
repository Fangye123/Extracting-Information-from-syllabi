Course Description:  

This interdisciplinary, team-taught course provides an overview of the
geography, history, politics, economics, societies and cultures of the diverse
nations comprising the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Twice this
century this area of the world has witnessed revolutionary changes that have
not only profoundly affected the lives of its citizens, but have also
influenced the course ofworld history. With the fall of communism and the end
of the Cold War, it is now more important than ever to understand this vital
region. Over the course of the semester, guest lecturers from the various
departments affiliated with the Center for Russian, East European and Eurasian
Studies will share their expertise, providing exposure to the many resources
and opportunities for the study of the fomer Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
at the University of Texas.

Course Requirements and Grading:  
  
The course is divided into three units corresponding to the following thematic
areas: I - Geography, History and Politics; II - Economics and Society; and
III - Culture. Each unit will be followed by an examination, which will
include multiple choice, identification and essay questions. The examinations
dates are October 2, October 30 and December 15. Please note that make-up
examinations will be given only in the case of verified medical emergencies.
Your final grade in the course will be based on the three unit examinations
(each accounting for 30% of the course grade) and class participation (10%).  
Our class sessions will typically consist of a lecture by a member of the
Center faculty, followed by at least 20 minutes of questions and discussion.
Students are strongly encouraged to ask questions before and after the
lectures, in the Instructor's and Teaching Assistant's office hours, and
during review sessions. Review questions will be distributed in class before
each unit examination.

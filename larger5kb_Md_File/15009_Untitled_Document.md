U.S. HISTORY 201: DISCOVERY TO 1877  
MON-WEDS-FRI 11:00-11:50

TEXT: Alan Brinkley, The Unfinished Nation.

COURSE DESCRIPTION: This course is a survey of United States history from
discovery through Reconstruction. It covers the major events and trends of the
period, their causes and effects, and the personalities involved. This survey
will present political, social, cultural, military, economic, religious,
intellectual, and geographical aspects of this period in U.S. history.

OBJECTIVES: Drawing from classroom lectures and discussions, assigned readings
from the text, and visual aids, you should be prepared to: a) demonstrate
knowledge and understanding of the material presented; b) provide analysis of
historical events; c) identify important events, personalities, trends, and
developments from the period covered in this course; d) locate on a map
important places and regions. In addition, you should gain an understanding of
how events of the past can impact the present and the future. You also should
develop skills in reading comprehension and written expression.

EXAMINATIONS AND QUIZZES: There will be three exams: two during the semester
and one non-comprehensive final. There also will be four unannounced pop
quizzes worth twenty points each. For each exam you will need to bring an exam
book (blue book), available in the bookstore. Final exams will be given as
scheduled; only official excuses will be recognized.

CLASSROOM PARTICIPATION: Your participation is worth 5% of your total grade.
This grade will be determined by your involvement in classroom discussions,
attendance, and behavior. Sleeping, eating, reading the newspaper, lateness,
or disrupting class will detract from this grade. Enthusiasm, attention, and
attendance will be rewarded.

ATTENDANCE: You are adults. You are expected to attend all classes; roll will
be taken. If you accumulate three unexcused absences you forfeit the entire
classroom participation grade. For each unexcused absence in excess of three
you are subject to lose a letter from your final grade. Official school
absences will be recognized as such. Quizzes may not be made up. If you miss
an exam due to an official absence, a make-up will be issued at my discretion.
No make-ups will be granted for unexcused absences.

  
BEHAVIOR: All students are encouraged to attend class, ask questions,
participate in discussions, complete reading assignments, and pay attention.
Please refrain from eating, reading newspapers, consuming drinks containing
ice, or any activity disruptive to the class. University regulations and
proper decorum should be observed. Any breech of academic integrity as
outlined in university policy will be handled accordingly.

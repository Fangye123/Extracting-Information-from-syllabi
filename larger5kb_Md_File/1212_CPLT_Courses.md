This interdisciplinary course is divided into two parts. The first part
explores the cultural and intellectual contexts for the constructions of
Africa, the Americas, Asia and "Others," grounding this construction in the
development of capitalism, trade, the slave trade, and wage slavery. Part One
of the course investigates the manner in which Africans and other peoples are
transformed and constructed as races and nations, incorporated into religious
and political orders as subjects and as objects of social structures. Part Two
maps Africa and "the Others" in social theory, specifically philosophy and
historiography, asking, among other things, whether there can be such a thing
as an African philosophy, whether the "subaltern can speak," and the role
feminist discourse plays in our understanding of "the other"? Students will be
encouraged to develop their own areas of interest and fields of research.
During the semester, scholars from a variety of disciplines will present
papers related to the topics.

_**The course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.**_

**REQUIREMENTS:** The course will be run as a seminar. Students will be
expected to attend classes on a regular basis, to do the required reading each
week, and to participate in seminar discussions. Each student will be expected
to make at least two written class presentations based upon the readings and
write a final research paper (20 pages). The class papers should be no more
than five to six type written pages. They will be read in class, forming,
together with the selected readings, the basis for class discussion. They must
be submitted to either Professor Bond or Gibson at the end of the class
period.

This seminar will focus on the ways in which American poetry after WWII has

media such as television and film, and how it has participated in and reacted
to the surge of interest in information technologies since the 1980s. Readings
will include theories of the postmodern media landscape and poetry from
William Carlos Williams to the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets.

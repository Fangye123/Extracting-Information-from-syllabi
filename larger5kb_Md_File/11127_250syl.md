HISTORY 250                                          SPRING 1991  
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES                              PROF. ATTREED

NOTE: This is an intermediate course.  It assumes that students have a basic
knowledge of medieval history, as can be gained from courses such as History
111 Rise of the Christian West, History 112 Emerging Europe 1000-1500, and/or
upper-division courses in medieval history.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
During this semester, we will study western Europe from the late thirteenth
through the fifteenth centuries.  This is a time period sometimes known as the
Later Middle Ages, and sometimes as the Early Renaissance, and one of our
tasks will be to determine whether society was concluding a period or starting
a new era.  It is a period very rich in surviving sources, both written and
visual, so we will have to be selective in the topics on which we focus.  The
subjects we will study include the nature of political power during the
period, changes in economy and society, the role of warfare in politics and
culture, religious evolution and the institution of the Church, disease and
population changes, and the quality of life in medieval society.

By way of acquiring or reviewing the background necessary to understanding the
period, students are required to read the following chapters in Robert S. Hoyt
and Stanley Chodorow, Europe in the Middle Ages, 3rd edition:  
           9 "The Feudal Organization of Medieval Europe"   
          10 "The World of Feudal Europe" and 11 "The Early Medieval Economy"   
          14 "The Development of Royal Government in the 12th Century"   
          18 "Religious Institutions, etc." up thru' page 44   
          21 "The Medieval Synthesis of Thought and Learning"   
This reading should be completed by the second week of class.  On exams and in  
papers, I will assume you know and understand the themes of this material.  If  
you have any problem with the readings, it is your responsibility to raise  
questions in class or to discuss them with me after class.

My office hours, held in O'Kane 390 (phone 793-2358), are Mondays and  
Wednesdays 3:30 to 5:00 p.m., and by appointment.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
Attendance is expected at all class meetings.  Excessive absences, defined at  
the discretion of the professor, will result in failure in the course.  The  
student is responsible for the content of all lectures and discussions of the  
class, and for all announcements made at such times.  Attendance is required  
for examinations; make-up exams are given only with authorization from the  
student's class dean.  Attendance forms ^&part\& of the grade for discussion  
and participation, but perfect attendance with little or no class discussion  
will not result in a perfect grade.  We will be dealing in this course with a  
great many articles and short readings, and sharing the information in class  
is essential to the study of this period.  In the event of bad weather,  
students are requested to wait quietly in the classroom until my arrival or  
notice of class cancellation.

The composition of the final grade can be found on the last sheet of this  
syllabus.  There will be one midterm exam, two 8-10 page papers centered on  
assigned readings (unable to be covered in class) on later medieval history,  
and a final (cumulative) examination.  
.PG  
NOTE: The readings for this course are numerous and varied.  There is no one  
adequate textbook for the later Middle Ages, nor does Dinand yet own all of
the  
material I would like you to sample this semester.  Hence, most of the
material  
will be found on Dinand reserve, often in the form of xeroxed articles.
Please  
do not take this course if you must be off campus frequently this semester, or  
if you do not like using reserve materials.  A complete list of the readings  
begins on page 4.

Ordered for the bookstore are: Allmand, ^&The Hundred Years' War\&; Froissart,  
^&Chronicles\&; Gottfried, ^&The Black Death\&; Hoyt and Chodorow, ^&Europe in  
the Middle Ages\&; Tuchman, ^&Practicing History\&; Waley, ^&Later Medieval
Europe\&;  
and Wolters, ^&Revelations of Divine Love\&.

For those who stick with this admittedly inconvenient format, be assured that  
I am interested in your opinions of the readings, and rely on your feedback to  
make this course better in the future.  Obviously, however, one must read the  
materials in order to have an opinion!

The assignments are divided into common readings which all students are  
required to do, and individual assignments which will be made in class.  For  
example, I will ask half the class to read the Myers article for Monday 21  
January, and the other half to look at the Dockray, all having read the  
Barraclough, too.  Class discussion will ideally result in such a complete  
exchange of information that the Myers half should not feel it necessary to  
take time to read the Dockray, and vice versa.  ALL students are held  
responsible for ALL the readings, hence this exchange should be as complete  
and as accurate as we can all make it.

PAPERS:

You are required to write two papers for this course.  Each should run  
about eight to ten pages, with proper reference apparatus which includes  
either footnotes or endnotes (I do not care which format you use), and a  
bibliography, both set forth in F. P. Prucha, ^&Research Papers in History\&,  
available in the bookstore (end of History section).  The first paper is  
due no later than 5 p.m. Monday 11 February 1991; the second paper is due no  
later than 5 p.m. Wednesday 10 April 1991.  Late papers, if unexcused by a  
class dean, will suffer a penalty of one letter grade (e.g., from B+ to B)  
per day late.  Margins should be 1" to 1 1/4" in size, pica or elite typeface  
used, and pages should be numbered, by hand if necessary.  Students should be  
reminded that the use of light gray ink puts an unnecessary and even dangerous  
strain upon the eyes of the person grading the paper, and should be avoided.

For the first paper, students should choose one of the topics listed in  
Section 1, below.  You should read the listed materials carefully, and in the  
prescribed pages (and probably not more than ten pages) summarize, analyze,
and  
assess their contents.  For this first paper, you are not ^&required\& to
consult  
other, related materials (although doing so tends to produce a better paper).  
Your paper should ultimately spend more time analyzing and assessing the  
material than just repeating its contents.  That means you will have to pay  
attention to the topics and/or problems examined in the article or chapter,  
the materials and sources the author used to make his/her case, the  
argument presented in the material, the clarity with which it is made, and  
the light it throws on late medieval history in general.  As far as possible,  
relate the readings to the general narrative of events we cover in class,
which  
should serve as your background.

The topics listed below are just some of those subjects we do not have time  
to cover fully in class.  The materials listed in each of the topics are  
not the ^&only\& things written on the subject, nor even the very best things  
written, but I have chosen them because they make interesting and often  
controversial contributions to the topic.  Under each heading, the materials  
relate to each other in a general way, but very often the authors wrote  
their contribution without knowledge of the others.  In your papers, you  
should be comparing the materials, but with the knowledge that they are  
discreet and independent entities.

In approaching the paper, you may want to consult any issue of the journal  
^&Speculum\&, the publication of the Medieval Academy of America.  The book  
reviews in this journal very often go beyond mere summary of volumes and  
collections, and can include the kind of comparison and analysis I am  
asking for in your papers.  Be aware also that the twelve volumes of the  
^&Dictionary of the Middle Ages\&, ed. Joseph Strayer (in Dinand's reference  
collection) provide accurate, concise, and indispensable background for a  
myriad of topics on the Middle Ages.  I urge you to consult these volumes  
often; please acknowledge them when you have borrowed from them.

In writing the paper, you should consider a few basic questions.  First of  
all, what is each writer saying, and how can you summarize that as briefly  
and as accurately as possible?  We will get lots of practice doing this in  
class discussion, but writing it is another, no less important, matter.  Also,  
what kind of evidence has the author mustered?  This means reading, and  
understanding, the author's notes/references.  Does the author try to  
consult primary sources, i.e. evidence generated in or near the time period  
under discussion?  Or does the author rely on secondary sources, i.e. modern  
interpretations of the medieval period?  Does he/she seem confident in the  
argument, or is it hedged with "might have beens" and "must have beens"?  Is  
the argument clear to you (this will be a personal judgement; it should be  
separated from whether you find the reading boring or not)?  What part or  
side does it contribute to the general topic?  What contribution does it  
make to our knowledge of the medieval past in general?  In teaching this  
course again, should I consider assigning the materials you read and wrote  
about to the class as a whole for group discussion?

For the second paper, you will repeat this process with a different topic,  
chosen from Section 2, below.  You will also be required to find, consult,  
and use at least one other writing (a book or article) related to the topic.  
These additional materials, as well as the weeks you have spent studying the  
period, are intended to help you better to assess the place these writings  
have in the history of the later Middle Ages.

In all the writings you submit to me, close attention should be paid to  
grammar, spelling, and reference style.  Yes, these things count toward the  
item's grade.  Please keep direct quotes to a minimum (3 per paper; if you  
desire to quote more than that, place the direct quotations in your notes).  
I am more interested in reading ^&your\& paraphrase and interpretation than
the  
author's.  Direct quotations over three lines long should be indented and  
single-spaced; sometimes it is far better to paraphrase the information in the  
text and put the direct quote in a footnote or endnote for purposes of  
verification.  If you quote from other works or paraphrase closely, you must  
make reference to them and their authors in the notes or you will be in danger  
of plagiarizing.  Papers written by you and submitted to other classes will  
not be acceptable or appropriate.  Papers written by other students and  
submitted as your own work will prompt me to charge you with plagiarism, a  
serious college offence.  Please submit an original and a xerox copy of your  
papers, as I will retain the latter for my files.

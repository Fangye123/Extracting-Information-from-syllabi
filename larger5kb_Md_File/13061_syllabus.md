**_Course Description:_**

**Humanities 3464 explores the concept of _community_ in Appalachia using a
multidisciplinary approach combined with classroom and experiential
learning.** **Key questions to be considered include:**

  * **What is community and how is it expressed in Appalachia?**
  * **From what factors does a sense of community arise?**
  * **What are the forces of cohesion and decay that have impacted Appalachian communities both historical and contemporary?**
  * **What are the formal and informal services, systems, and institutions that affect quality of life in Appalachia?**
  * **How are Appalachian communities the same and different from the heavily industrialized interior of the Alleghany-Cumberland Plateau to the more agricultural valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountain region or the Shenandoah Valley?**
  * **Does a sense of community carry over to urban Appalachian centers like Pittsburgh, Knoxville, Asheville, Charleston, and Roanoke? Why and how?**
  * **Is the concept of community undergoing change or evolution in contemporary Appalachia? In what ways?**
  * **How can the region maintain a vision of community for the future?**

**Humanities 3464 will explore these questions and issues through a variety of
written texts, films, songs, and experiential field trips that will provide a
basis for student discussion and projects.**

**Students also will hear lectures from the course instructor as well as from
guests from various university departments, especially those with courses
cross-listed with Humanities 3464. Guest speakers might also include members
of various Appalachian communities, who would share their perspectives and
insights on a variety of community issues.**

**Weekend (overnight) field trips and (single day) workdays will allow
students opportunities to observe and participate in evolving notions of
community and community action in Appalachia. Students are thus encouraged to
participate in these field trips and/or workdays which--along with additional
reflective journal entries--will allow students to earn a considerable portion
of their course grade from community-related activities. Students who choose
not to participate in these activities will earn the same portion of their
grade from more traditional activities, such as mid-term and final exams.**



******_Course Texts (required):_**

  * **_Fighting Back in Appalachia_ , Ed. Dr. Stephen L. Fisher (purchase)**

  * **_Citizen Power: Stories of America's New Civic Spirit_ , Robin Epstein(purchase)**
  * **_Mountain Voices: the Socio-Cultural Ramifications of Severe Declines in Coal Mining Employment and Production in the Southwestern Virginia Coalfields_ , Dr. Stephen Mooney (available online @: http://www.energy.vt.edu/Publications/pubsframe.html#reports)**



**_Educational Objectives_**

**Having completed this course, students will be able to:**

  * **Define the concept of community and identify many of its expressions in Appalachia;**
  * **Articulate the interrelationships among geographically, culturally, and socially constituted communities, public policy, and human development;**
  * **Identify formal and informal services and systems that affect quality of life in Appalachian communities and conflicts that arise among them; and**
  * **Observe and interact with Appalachian community residents and analyze their expressions of community, commitment, and their relationships to other social and cultural contexts.**

**_Course Methodology_**

**Our basic course methods are encapsulated by the following quotations or
phrases:**

  * **_"I'm not a religious man myself but I don't question them that is"_** **\-- Hassel Day, in Denise Giardina's _The Unquiet Earth_**

**Hassel's comment applies a good deal to me. So even though I may not know my
scriptures as well as I ought to, I do believe in spirit and the power of the
word and of the human voice. As a result, our basic approach is grounded in
sacred scripture. In effect, through a series of activities we will "witness"
and "testify;" we will observe and participate in various aspects of
Appalachian community and then reflect on our experiences and relate them to
our own lives and communities.**

  * **_"Maximum participation of the poor"_** ** [in this case, of students]**

**This 1960s War on Poverty slogan describes the way the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO) envisioned the participation of Appalachian citizens in
Community Action Programs (CAPS). In the end, though the concept was not
supported by longterm legislation and effort, for a brief time, federal
funding actually followed a process where it went straight from the government
to citizens participating in CAPS. These were everyday people who were intent
on fostering positive change in their mountain communities, be the price job
loss, political or judicial pressure, or their lives (all apply).**

**It is in this spirit that the instructor hopes that students in Humanities
3464 will choose to include themselves in community-level projects and
activities which will allow them to earn substantial portions of their
grade.**

**Finally, as Doc Booker says in Denise Giardina's _Storming Heaven_ ,**

  * **_"A good man [or woman] can make a difference in a little place like this."  
  
_****Enough said!**

**



**[ 1] ****Each student will be present in class and will read (or watch or
listen to) all of the assignments and be prepared to discuss them in class on
the assigned day.**

**[ 2] ****Each student will keep a reflective journal (in any kind of folder
or notebook; word processed/typed entries preferred but not required) that
explores issues emerging from the course readings, lectures, films, and
discussions as they relate to the topic of community in Appalachia. The
journal may also include newspaper or magazine clippings or notes about other
readings that pertain to the course, as well as in-class writings in response
to issues under discussion. The journal will be collected three-four times by
the Instructor and evaluated for completeness and depth of engagement. 30%**

**[ 3] ****Each student will complete a final course project that may emerge
from readings, films, lectures, or discussions, or from experiential learning.
The project may take a variety of forms: an analytical essay, a website, a
short story, a collection of poems. Each student should discuss potential
projects with the Instructor before moving ahead. 30%**

**[ 4] ****Each student has the option of:**

> **_Option A_ : choosing the experiential learning course plan. This plan
requires each student to participate in a number of scheduled field trips or
workdays and to also produce a series of additional journal entries (topics to
be worked out with the Instructor) which respond to issues that emerge from
their experiential learning. 30%**

>

> **_Option B_ : choosing the traditional classroom-based course plan. This
plan requires each student, in lieu of participation in experiential learning,
to take a midterm (15%) and final exam (15%) covering readings, lectures,
films, and discussions. 30%**

**The standard university grading scale will be applied.**

******_Course Policies_**

**_The Virginia Tech Honor Code will be strictly enforced in this course.
Students are required to familiarize themselves with it._**

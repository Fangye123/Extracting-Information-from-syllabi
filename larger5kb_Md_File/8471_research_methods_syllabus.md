**I. Course Description**

This course covers experimental research methods in Social Psychology (and, to
some extent, related disciplines). Research design, data collection, analysis,
validity, and report writing will all be covered. The course satisfies both
the laboratory requirement for psychology majors and the WIC requirement.
Because this is a WIC course, a substantial part of the course requirements
are written (see attached sheet of WIC course requirements). The format of the
course will be mixture of lecture and discussion, writing, and demonstrations.

**II. Course Objectives**

  * Introduce students to social psychological research methods 
  * Understand science and its relationship to social issues 
  * Familiarization with writing and reporting issues in professional psychology 
  * Improvement of students' writing skills, especially those concerned with accurate communication of information and rational arguments 

**III. Text**

Required:  
    Graziano, A. M., & Raulin, M. L. (1997). _Research methods: A process of inquiry_. New York: Longman. 

Also Useful:  
    American Psychological Association (1994). _Publication manual of the American Psychological Association_ (4th Ed.). Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association. 

    Rosnow, R. L., & Rosnow, M. (1995). _Writing papers in psychology_. Pacific Grove: Brooks/Cole. 

Sternberg  & Parrott also have books on writing psychology papers.  


**IV. Grading**  
The final grade is based on 200 total possible points: 30 points for the
midterm, 60 for the final exam, 16 for the questions about the readings (2
points X 8 questions), 28 points for the short papers (7 points X 4 papers), 6
points for the peer reviews (3 points X 2 reviews), and 60 points for the term
paper.

Grade distributions will be based on the performance of all the students in
the class (i.e., grades are curved). The class average grade will be
equivalent to a B- (that is, a person whose point total is at or close to the
class average will get a B- for the class). Grades above the class average
will be equivalent to a B or better; grades below the class average will be
equivalent to a C+ or worse. Graduate students will not be included in the
curve for undergraduates (i.e., undergraduates do not have to compete against
graduate students), but will be graded relative to the undergraduate curve. If
the curve falls too far off of a normal distribution, I will make allowances
for this (e.g., if everybody's point totals are bunched together).

**V. Class Attendance**  
Class attendence is the student's responsibility (i.e., not mine). Students
are responsible for everything covered in class. This includes details about
the tests or paper, changes, etc. Students are also responsible for the
activities we do in class; **including graded activities**. If you miss them,
you miss the points. Therefore, I strongly advise class attendence. If you
have to miss a class, be sure to get any lecture notes from another class
member (i.e., not from me). Please help each other out!

Make-up tests and exams are rarely given and are difficult. DOCUMENTED
problems should be discussed with the instructor PRIOR to the test, or, in the
extremely rare case of an emergency which prevents contacting the instructor
prior to the test, as soon as possible. I intend to be quite strict about
this. Note that having other assignments, tests, or exams due, friends in
town, vacation plans, hangovers and the like do not constitute acceptible
excuses, neither for missing nor rescheduling a test, paper, or the exam. I
will not move the test or exam times for individuals for any reason. This
EXPRESSLY includes vacation/holiday plans. You have prior warning!

**VII. Written assignments** (I reserve the right to make changes to these as
the term progresses):

As per WIC requirements, students will have frequent opportunities to write.
Students will write questions about the reading assignments, several short
papers, do peer reviews of other students' essays, and write a longer term
paper. **Students should identify themselves on all assignments in this class
ONLY using their social security number. No names should be put on any of the
written assignments (or the tests).**

The papers are due in class on the dates noted on the syllabus. No extensions.
I intend to take off the following number of points per assignment for every
24 hour period after the time the paper is due (which starts at the beginning
of class, the day its due):

Questions about the readings - 2 pts  
Short Papers - 3 1/2 pts  
Peer reviews - 3 pts  
Term Paper - 10 pts

In other words, if I get your short paper at 4PM instead of 2PM on the day its
due, you lose 3 1/2 of the 7 pts. After 2 PM the next day, you lose all 7 pts.
I advise you to try to finish assignments early to avoid possible printer
problems, flat tires, etc. I will take them early if you want to give them to
me early. If you have to miss class on the day an assignment is due, get the
assignment to my box in the Psychology office before class time. I might be
willing to accept electronic submission (i.e., via email), so long as I get it
shows up prior to the due time.

The written assignments are as follows:

**1) Questions about the reading assignments** \- At the start of each Tuesday
class, students will turn in an informed question pertaining to the readings
for that week. The students and I will attempt to address at least some of
these during class. These will be graded as check (you turned it in  &
addressed the assignment) or 0 (you didn't turn it in or didn't really attempt
the assignment in a meaningful way). A check gets you 2 points and a 0 gets
you 0 points. Obviously, this means you have to get the readings assigned for
a week done by the 1st class meeting of that week (i.e., the readings for week
2 have to be done by Oct. 7).

**2) Short papers** \- on the Thursdays noted below, students will turn in a
short (between 1 and 2 pages) paper (typed, double-spaced). These will be
graded check (7 points) or 0 (no points), using the standards described under
#1 above. The assignments  & the dates they are due are:

* Oct. 9 - Come up with two general, abstract questions about human behavior that you would like answered.  Then, **observe** the people around you, think, and see if you can answer your question.   Describe what you observed and how that answered your question. 

*Oct. 23 - Come up with a big, **socially important question** that is currently being discussed in our society. For ideas, you might want to take a look at the bills that have been considered by Congress, social programs or problems, issues discussed in the media, etc. Discuss, in general terms, some hypothetical studies that should be conducted to answer the question (i.e., to provide evidence bearing on the question). (These will be peer reviewed.) 

*Nov. 13 - **Term Paper proposal**. Write a detailed proposal, including references to key sources you intend to use, which outlines your term paper topic (see below for term paper requirements). This means you should know what your hypothesis is, and have already done some library research relevant to it. You should also have a general idea of your methods. I will give you feedback on this. 

*Nov. 20 - Make up and briefly describe **an experiment** of your own design (i.e., don't copy the methods from another source) that tests a hypothesis related to social psychology. This should be a different experiment and hypothesis than the one you use for your term paper. You must _manipulate_ something in this study (e.g., no demographic I.V.s like gender or age). Be sure to describe your hypothesis and the rationale underlying it, the methods you will use (including concrete descriptions of the independent and dependent variables), and your expected results. (These will be peer reviewed.)   
    Note:  Graduate students have to do a little more on this paper, so that the class meets university requirements for graduate students.  Grad students (only) should, for the experiment paper, use more detail and write a 3-4 page paper.  Also, your experiment should be on a topic in your particular area. 

**3) Peer Reviews** \- For two of the above assignments, students will
critique another person's paper. This will involve reading the paper, rating
the paper on several scales, and writing constructive comments about the
paper's strengths and weaknesses. I will give you a form for this. These
comments will be given to the author. The reviews will be graded on the check
(3 pts), 0 pts system. (These will be done in class)

**4) Term Paper** \- Students will do a term paper of between 10 and 15 pages
(typed, double-spaced). This is due Dec. 4. The paper should describe, in
detail, a hypothetical experiment (other than the one you did for your short
paper or one from another source). The hypothesis should be controversial in
the sense that one could reasonably predict more than one outcome on the basis
of prior psychological theory/research (which you should describe in your
paper). Also, no demographic I.V.s. The paper should be in APA format.  This
includes citatin format, use of headers, inclusion of an abstract, etc.  It
should include an Introduction, in which you describe your hypothesis and the
psychological literature relevant to it, a Methods section, which describes
your experimental procedures in detail, a Results section, in which you make
up some expected results (simple statistics are desirable, but complicated
ones are unnecessary), and a Discussion section in which you discuss the
ramifications of your experiment. The term paper is worth 60 possible points.
A **rough** guide to the way I will grade these papers is as follows. (This is
simply designed to give you some idea of my priorities. It is neither a
complete nor an precise list.)

Failure to cite the source of an idea -2 (per occurrence)

Copying material word-for-word from a source w/out appropriate citation:  
        up to two sentences                                                                                   -5 per instance   
        a larger section                                                                                          -40   
        most or all of a paper                                                                                 course failure at best   
Vague or incomprehensible explanation/desciption
-3 (per occurrence)  
Incorrect or absent  lit review
-10  
Failure to attempt to design an experiment as per the assignment
-40  
Attempt to but fail to design an experiment
-30  
Experiment doesn't test the hypothesis
-20  
Lack of precision in the methods section  
    (e.g., you don't explain your operationalization, etc.)                                         -15   
Inadequate explanation (you leave something important out)
-3  
Unintelligeable sentence
-1  
Technical errors (lapses from APA style, spelling errors  
    that could have been spell-checked on your computer, bad grammer etc.)           -1 per occurrence   

**VII. Tests**  
There will be a midterm worth 30 pts (Oct. 30) and a final worth 60 pts (Dec.
10, 2 PM).

      ![Blue Separator Bar](photos/bluebar.jpg)   **Overview**   
HIS 102 reviews the general history of the West from around 1600 ce to the
present and allows students to reach a basic understanding of the
characteristic features of the West's historical development.  The course also
helps students to develop an understanding of the academic discipline of
history and supports the general educational goals of historians and the
college.  Grading in the course is based on written assignments and on class
work that demonstrates critical thinking.  It is expected that students
already possess college-level writing skills.   There are many reasons to
study history.  For example, history provides a good background for careers in
law, journalism, teaching, engineering and politics.  Since most people will
change careers many times in the course of their life, it is desirable to have
as wide an educational experience as practical to prepare for future
possibilities.  Another reason for studying history is that it provides a
framework for understanding the other humanities, such as the fine arts,
literature, philosophy and religion, as well as the other social sciences
(psychology, economics and sociology).  History also helps to develop active
and intelligent citizens who can distinguish between the important and the
inconsequential, fact and conjecture, evidence and assertion, and make
informed judgements in personal and public life.  Finally, the study of
history is a humbling experience, for the historical record is resplendent
with tales of ignorance, deceit, arrogance and brutality.

World**.   There are a number of short paperbacks required:  Charles Dickens,

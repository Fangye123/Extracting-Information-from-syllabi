### **Course Description**

This course deals with the essential concepts and principles that underlie
modern practices in sport, physical education, fitness, intramurals, and
athletics. In an effort to promote a better understanding of these modern
programs, we will consider the origins of various physical and sport
activities by studying the activities of selected peoples and cultures.
Emphasis is given to the growth and development of physical education and
sport in America from the colonial period to the modern era.

online ordering.

  

### **Suggested Method of Study**

Before you answer the questions in the writing assignments, read the lesson
objectives first! You should be aware of the _expected outcomes_ at the very
beginning of each lesson. In many of the lessons, supplementary notes have
been provided to improve your understanding of the concepts. Lessons 2 and 6
use color prints. These prints are intended to support the discussion notes,
glossaries and textbook chapters by providing a visual image of the concepts
pertaining to the Greeks, the Olympic Games, and the Romans. In addition
several lessons include graphics, figures, and appendices to assist you in
understanding the ideas presented in the textbook and web guide. As you read
the text and discussion notes, write concise but complete answers to the
writing assignments. The answers you write are your "class notes" and should
be valuable to you in studying for the midcourse and final examinations. Write
answers in your _own words_ \--avoid writing long direct quotations and
passages from the text. In some instances it is not necessary to send all the
writing assignments. Be sure to check the instructions in each of the lessons
for further information on what items must be e-mailed for grading.  

  
**Examinations**

The course has two supervised examinations, each covering approximately half
the content in the course. The examinations will consist of identification and
essay questions, similar to those on the lesson writing assignments.  

The final examination is **not** comprehensive. Material for the final
examination will be drawn from ideas and concepts discussed in Lessons 9
through 12.  

  

### **Grading Policy & Standards**

Each lesson contains supplementary notes, objectives, reading assignments and
a writing assignment. Color prints are provided for two of the lessons. Your
final course grade will be based on the following factors:  

    Lessons                               30%     Midterm Examination          35%     Final Examination                 35%

Your letter grades will be based upon percentage of points earned:  92 -100%
| = A | 72 - 77% | = C | 90 - 91% | = A- | 70 - 71% | = C- | 88 - 89% | = B+ |
68 - 69% | = D+ | 82 - 87% | = B | 62 - 67% | = D | 80 - 81% | = B- | 60 - 61%
| = D- | 78 - 79% | = C+ | 59% or below | = F  
---|---|---|---

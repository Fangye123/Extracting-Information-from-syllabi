**DESCRIPTION AND GOALS**  
What is Europe, how has it developed, and why has this little peninsula off
the western end of Asia come to matter so much in world history? These are the
organizing questions of History 2070/Cultural Studies 3070, Readings in Early
European History. The course introduces major themes in European history, East
and West, from the early Middle Ages to the nineteenth century. The work of
the seminar is oral and written discussion of major scholarly studies with
broad implications for understanding pre-modern European societies,
institutions, and cultures. The events of the last decade or so make it clear
that to divide Europe into "Eastern" and "Western" does not reflect the long
view of the European past, and that the nation-state is often still an
inadequate basis for understanding Europeans' own identities. This colloquium
will seek out the origins of European exceptionalism and European diversity.  
  
**FORMAT**  
This is a discussion course, with a) common reading, usually a book, each
week, b) short weekly papers, and c) supplementary reports.

Each week before the class meeting and no later than Wednesday morning at 10,
students will submit a short (500-700 words) critical commentary on the common
reading at hand; these papers will serve to organize discussion and debate.
Papers might take the form of a summary analysis, focus on a specific aspect
of a given book's subject matter, or discuss nitty-gritty matters (e.g. source
use, organization, style). The only strict guidelines are that the papers
demonstrate serious thought about the work at hand and are written in elegant
and lucid prose making your reflections readily accessible to others.

Each participant will also present to the colloquium another book in oral and
written form once during the semester. An oral report of about 10 minutes will
summarize the book and its conclusions and make comparisons to the common
reading to elicit further discussion. No more than two weeks later, there will
also be a formal written review of 1200-1500 words, in the style of reviews in
academic journals, to be distributed to all members of the colloquium.

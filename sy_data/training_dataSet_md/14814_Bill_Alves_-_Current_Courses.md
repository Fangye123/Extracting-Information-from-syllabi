  * Humanities 1 - _Introduction to the Humanities: American Isms: Art, Music and Literature_ (Fall). [Co-taught with Prof. Jeff Groves.]  
Humanities 1 is an introduction to college level studies in the humanities and
social sciences focusing on the development of essential reading, critical
thinking, research, and writing skills. _American Isms_ traces the fascinating
interrelationships that bridge American art, music, and literature through
both familiar artists (Dickinson, Whitman, Whistler, Copland) and less
familiar ones (Tuckerman, Bierstadt, Harrison). We will also cover a wide
variety of aesthetic forms: from romantic lyric to free-verse poem; from
landscape painting to landscape cinema; from transcendental essay to modernist
novel; from the symphony to the rock opera. In addition to reading
assignments, students in this section will also have weekly listening
assignments, though no previous musical experience is required.

Humanities 2 is a continuation of the methods and skills taught in Humanities

social sciences focusing on the development of essential reading, critical
thinking, research, and writing skills. _Music and the Arts in the Twentieth
Century_ looks at several of the most important trends in twentieth-century
music and the ways in which they are mirrored by contemporary trends in
literature, the visual arts, and society. Readings include sources in the
artists' own words as well as secondary criticism and analysis. No previous

**1\. Aims of the course**.  The Core Course is an important course every
freshman has to take at the University of Richmond. As a continuation of the
Fall semester, it will continue to

  1. to develop your ability to read, think, speak, and write;
  2. to enlarge your understanding of the problem of giving meaninig to life; and
  3. to establish a foundation for University-wide conversatiion on serious questions.

And we will continue to pursue these aims by having you analyze the ways
gifted and articulate people across times, cultures, creeds and backgrounds go
about the business of making sense out of life in their writings. The
_overarching_ theme of this semester will be "the demands of the world"--those
things outside the self in nature and society that complicate matters for it.
We will highlight less what what we ask of the world than what it will let us
have. The two themes are intimately related, of course. We expect you to think
back often to books you read last semester.

**2\. Course work.** The main responsability of the student is twofold: read
the assigned texts and think/discuss about them critically. We will continue
to work on your ability to think critically and analytically and to express
our ideas effectively orally and in writing.

Before we start a text, a group of students will have the responsability to
give the basic information to the entire class. These will consistent in
providing background information on the text, the author and the society from
which he/she speaking from. In addition, expect to write short response papers
for every book we read. This semester, we will write two essay papers, two
exams and one final (comprehensive).

**3\. Grading** : Assignments of the grades are as follows:  
  2 papers  | 30 %  
---|---  
2 examinations  | 30 %  
Oral participation  | 10 %  
Assigned homework  | 10 %  
Final examination  | 20 %  
  
The grading will be based on the following scale:  
  **A+** = 100-97  | A = 96-93  | A- = 92-90  
---|---|---  
B+= 89-87  | B = 86-83  | B- = 82-80  
C+= 79-77  | C = 76-73  | C- = 72-70  
D+= 69-67  | D = 66-63  | C- = 62-60  
F = 59-00  | Same  | Same  
  
**4\. Attendance.** Attendance to all the class sessions and other outside
activities related to the course are required. Three unexcused absences may go
unpunished. Any additional unexcused absence will cause a substraction of 0.5%
(on a 100 scale) from the final grade. Note that an excused absence does not
exempt you from any graded assignment given on the day. It may result in an F
grade for the work not done.

**  7\. Directions for Papers.** Paper topics will consist in an essay in
which you will be directed to engage in a discussion. Here are some directions
before you start writing your paper.

**A. Thesis.** Generally speaking, papers will have as purposes to influence
or persuade a particular audience to your thesis on texts read in the course.
Beforehand, have and state your thesis as a response to the topic given. Have
an outline how the thesis will be dealt with.

**B. Structure and Organization.** A good structure is often a base for a good
essay. Develop your essay along the following parts:

  1.  Introduction: it clearly states the thesis, identifies the purpose of the paper, sets the tone, gives some ideas how the thesis will develop.
  2. Body: It supports the main thesis and develops the argument to that end. Rely on clear topic sentences to devise your paragraphs as a strategy to reach your destination. Make sure that there are clear and logical connections between the three parts, and the paragraphs within each of the main sections. You need to build bridges between paragraphs.
  3. Conclusion: It will strengthen the purpose of the essay by means of emphasis, summary, or evaluation.

**C. Determine your audience.** An imaginary and yet suitable audience would
be a fellow student you need to convince to your ideas. You should therefore
assume that he does not necessarily operate on the same "unproven" assumptions
than yourself. For example, many essays grounded their argumentation on
beliefs and assumptions supposedly shared with the imaginary audience. You
should often wonder if the audience you are addressing, skeptical and well
informed, shares your beliefs. You may also consider responding to the author
under consideration.

**D. The Texts.** Since your assignments are based on texts read in class, a
judicious use and a demonstrated knowledge of the texts will be relevant in
the evaluation of the essay. To that end, the way you (argumentation) go about
it will be of great importance in the evaluation of the essay.

**E. Evaluation and Criteria**  
  1\. Clear statement of a thesis:  | 10 %  
---|---  
 2\. Structure and organization:  |  15 %  
 3\. Ability to summarize main ideas  |  10 %  
 4\. Ability to analyze/viewpoints ...  |  25 %  
 5\. Ability to support a position with information derived from the texts  |
20 %  
 6\. Student's originality  |  10 %  
 7\. Readability: Language & Mechanics  |  10 %  
  
**F. Writing Fellows.** Appointments with the writing fellows is not optional,
but **mandatory**. You are required to respect your appointment. Any missed
appointment on unacceptable grounds will be penalized with 10 % off the grade.

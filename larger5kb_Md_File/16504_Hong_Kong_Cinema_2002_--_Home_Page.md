News and Announcements _  \-- _ [Last updated 3/20/2002]  
**_"Keep an eye on this section of the home page_** **_\- it will be the most
frequently updated,_**

* **_and often will contain vital information!!_**

  * The **Student Web Presentations** now appear on 2 pages - [page one](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/hk2002/ClipAnalyses1.html) & [page two](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/hk2002/ClipAnalyses2.html).
  


  * Here is a  [List of Readings, Films, and Web Presentations covered on the Midterm](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/hk2002/MidtermTopics.pdf)
  
 (The midterm will take place Tues. 2/26/02, in class)  


  * Advice on how to approach planning and writing your Web Presentation text (as well as your final paper) is available in the  [Guidelines & Hints for Web Presentations handout](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/hk2002/CloseAnalysisHowTo.pdf).
  


  * I'm starting to put together a [list of Hong Kong film titles which are available](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/hk2002/Avail_Films.pdf) on DVD or VHS, either through the Lilly Library, or through me (from the Duke Film & Video Program collection). These include both titles which are being screened in class and also additional titles that you could write about for your web presentation or for your final paper.  There are a number of titles still to add to this list, as well as some call #s which need to be found, for the most recently acquired titles.  This list will be updated as I get more information.
  


  * Feel free to peruse [Hank's 'Hong Kong to Hollywood' charts](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/intro01/HK_E2W.pdf) \- listing Hollywood films made with Hong Kong talent.
  


  * Unsure about some of the new terminology and film studies [vocabulary](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/Filmterm.htm) that is coming up in the readings and lectures? Check out Bordwell & Thompson's very helpful Glossary. And to find additional definitions, look up particular words or terms in the online database of  [The All-Movie Guide Glossary of Film Terms](http://allmovie.com/avg_glossary.html) or browse through the [Words of Art-- _Film Studies_ page](http://www.ouc.bc.ca/fina/glossary/f_list/filmstudieshome.html). [NB: The definitions in the "All-Movie Guide" are of varying quality. This should not be your primary source for definitions, but it can sometimes be helpful as a backup.] To get you started I have prepared a listing of  some of the [useful film terms](http://www.duke.edu/web/film/Filmterm.htm) you will find in these sources.

required text books will eventually be available in PDF format in the table

of acquiring these readings is to load them in Netscape or Internet Explorer

the spot.)

**Course Summary:**

     This course will present an in depth analysis of the use of prisons as the principal means of punishing criminal offenders and controlling criminal behavior. Prisons arose to replace earlier forms of punishment including capital punishment, mutilation and branding, slavery, banishment, and estate forfeiture. Why were these punishments rejected? Were they deemed ineffective or anti-humanitarian? In the first section of the course we will investigate the experimentation with imprisonment in Europe from the 17th through the 19th centuries. In addition to Spierenberg, we will discuss Foucault's theory that the development of prisons represented a shift from control over the body to the domination of the mind.

    From here we will discuss the early history of prisons in the United States. Rothman has argued that prisons arose in America as a humane experimental alternative to earlier punitive English punishments. The early prison systems developed in Pennsylvania and New York will be compared. Later American developments such as the Reformatory Movement, the warehouse era, and the emergence of the medical model in corrections will be examined. Particular focus will then be placed on the major changes in American prisons from the 1960s through the 1990s including the rejection of institutional authority by inmates, the growth of correctional staff professionalization and unionization, prison rioting, and the effects of the rejection of the medical model coupled with the introduction of stiff new sentencing guidelines on institutional overcrowding and prison population management.

    In the second half of the course we will attempt to answer a number of basic questions concerning everyday life inside contemporary prisons. For example: Who actually goes to prison and why, and for how long? How do maximum, medium, and minimum security facilities differ? How important is effective management and leadership to the operation of an efficient and safe prison system? What are the inmate subcultures new arrivals are likely to face? How do male and female inmate subcultures differ? How do inmates cope with the pains of imprisonment such as the deprivations of freedom, goods, sex, and social status? How has inmate litigation and federal judicial involvement in the everyday affairs of state prisons and local jails changed correctional policy? What social services and educational or vocational training is actually available for inmates? Is rehabilitation possible? Are adequate reintegrative services provided, particularly for high risk offenders?

**Reading Schedule:**

     By reading three chapters a week in Spierenburg followed by employing the same pace to read Rothman we should finish these two books about halfway through the semester. Study questions on these sources are provided; we will cover them as part of in-class small group discussion. The rest of the semester will be spent discussing the Haas and Alpert reader. One part of this text will be covered each week with student led discussion. Study questions will be provided a week in advance by the student who has chosen to be the discussion leader for a selected individual article.

**Final Exam--December 13**

![](http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/images/wire.gif)

**Attendance, Testing, and Grading Policies:**

     There will be one exam in this course, to be given on December 13th. It will cover all readings, classroom lecture and discussion, guest speakers, and any films/video tapes shown in class. It will be worth one third of the student's final grade. Another third of the student's grade will be drawn from the term paper (described below). The final third will be based on classroom presentations and discussion, including a brief overview of the student's research paper.

    You may receive your grade early by providing the instructor with a stamped, self-addressed envelope large enough to contain your blue book. Do not call me to find out about grades!

![](http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/images/wire.gif)

**Term Paper Requirements:**

     The term paper must focus on a particular aspect of corrections. Examples might include inmate subcultures, correctional staffing, secure juvenile institutions, prison rehabilitative programs, sentencing patterns, the death penalty, private prisons, prison design or architecture, corrections law, social history of penology, etc. 
    Your paper must be double-spaced, with standard margins (approximately 1" all around), and consist of a minimum 15 pages of text, not including title page, bibliography, or illustrations. You must use at least 15 sources in your paper. Papers must include pagination. The selected additional bibliography can provide you with a good start for your paper. Criminal Justice Abstracts is another good source for locating recent journal articles. [The CD Rom on the Tampa campus has Social and Behavioral Sciences Index.] 
    The system of citation and referencing detailed in the accompanying [handout](http://www.stpt.usf.edu/~greek/class.html) must be followed. Any other questions concerning style or format should be referred to Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (3rd. edition, 1983). Any major format deviations will result in the loss of a letter grade. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.

    The first paragraph of your paper is most important. The major theme or topic of your paper should be stated in the very first sentence. Each following sentence in the first paragraph should introduce the remaining subtopics of the paper. In other words, the paper will begin with an outline or abstract of its contents.

    A draft of your paper will be due four weeks prior to the last day of class, on November 8th. At that time your paper will be evaluated by a fellow classmate using the accompanying evaluation guide. One week later another student will evaluate your paper. You will then have one week to reedit your paper incorporating your classmates' suggestions. The final version of the paper will be due one week prior to the last day of class, on December 6th. A short presentation (approximately 20 minutes) of your paper will also be given on December 6th.

    All paper topics must be turned in for approval on Sept. 13th. An outline and partial bibliography (10 sources) will be due on Oct. 4th. All late papers will be assigned a 1/2 letter grade penalty for each day they are late.

**Sample Final Exam Questions**

1\. Discuss the types of penalties which preceded the advent of prison as the
major means on controlling crime. Why is  "idleness" rather than "social
class" the key concept in understanding who was likely to be incarcerated in
early modern prisons? What is Spierenburg's position on the theory that early
prisons were created to provide training for an undisciplined workforce
necessary for the advent of modern capitalism? Why was the prison's choice to
sentence offenders to rasping wood considered an important clue in answering
this question?

2\. Discuss the hierarchical administrative structure typical of early Dutch
prisons. How does it differ from contemporary American institutions? In what
ways were early prisons "visible" institutions rather than places to hide
offenders from mainstream society? Why did the familial model of a household
economy and structure come to be the predominant one within early prisons? In
what ways did early prisons resemble total institutions (Goffman)? In what
ways were they different? How were early Dutch prisons different from 19th
Century British prisons or contemporary Chinese penal institutions?

3\. Why does Rothman argue that the American Colonists accepted both poverty
and crime as nonproblematic aspects of society? What were the three pillars of
society the Colonists depended upon to prevent crime? How were law and
criminality related in the minds of post-colonial Americans? What role did
prison play in their thought? Why did Jacksonian Americans believe that
"civilization" itself was producing insanity and crime?

4\. Compare the day-to-day routines of early prisons in Pennsylvania and New
York. Discuss the debates over the relative merits of the Pennsylvania and New
York prison systems. What were the major correctional innovations advocated by
the Reformatory Movement? Compare the treatment of mentally ill criminal
inmates as discussed by Rothman and as depicted in the two "Asylum" films.

5\. How did sentencing patterns employed by the state of Florida and the
federal government change during the 1980s? What has been the impact of these
changes on their respective correctional systems? Discuss the arguments which
have been made concerning why blacks make up such a disproportionate number of
contemporary incarcerates?

6\. Discuss the following aspects of contemporary prison inmate subculture:
[a] violence [b] gangs [c] how female prison inmate subculture is different
from male inmate subculture [d] the relationship between prison guards and
snitches [e] riots.

7\. What role does law play in contemporary corrections? Be sure to discuss
federal court involvement in the day-to-day operations of prisons, inmate
access to lawyers and the courts, prisoners' due process and substantive
rights, the specific rights of jail detainees, 42 U.S.C.¡ì 1983, and liability
within private prisons. Discuss Texas and New Mexico as examples of how inmate
lawsuits have impacted on corrections. How is AIDS in prison likely to be
treated as a legal issue?

8\. Discuss the recent debates over the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness
of prison rehabilitation efforts. According to James Q. Wilson, what works and
what doesn't when it comes to rehabilitation programs? Are prison boot camps
effective? Why do you think that the parolees depicted in "Convicts on the
Street" had such higher recidivism rates than those featured in "Delancy
Street?"

9\. Discuss the following statement: While community-based correctional
alternatives were first suggested as a liberal humanitarian alternative to
prison, they are now being depicted as conservative crime-control policies.
Discuss the pros and cons of the following community-based innovations: [a]
intensive supervision probation [b] electronic monitoring [c] community
service [d] restitution. How have the following factors impacted community
corrections over the last decade? [a] changes in Florida sentencing laws [b]
the increase in AIDS clients [c] government funding.

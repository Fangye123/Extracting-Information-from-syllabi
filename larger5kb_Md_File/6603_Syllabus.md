CALL FOR PAPERS  
  
**_WRITING THE PAST, CLAIMING THE FUTURE  
WOMEN AND GENDER IN SCIENCE, MEDICINE, AND TECHNOLOGY  
  
_** October 12-15, 2000  
Saint. Louis University  
St. Louis, MO  
  
"Writing the past, claiming the future" is being designed to further
conversations begun at previous conferences among historians of science,
medicine, and technology. These discussions made explicit how much historians
of science, medicine, and technology can learn  
from each other. It is is intended to invite greater interchange among the
disciplines, while recognizing the uniqueness of each.  
  
Conference themes will include, but not be limited to, personal and external
factors that empower or inhibit women's participation in the scientific,
medical, and technological disciplines; scientific, medical, and technological
ideas that have influenced ideas about gender and gender roles in the
disciplines and in the wider society; and the relationship  
between gender and conceptions of knowledge and the practice of science,
medicine, and technology.  
  
Individual papers and panels are solicited on topics that explore the
interdisciplinary relationships of women and gender and science, medicine, and
technology. Conference organizers strongly encourage the submission of panels
of two or three papers. We are particularly interested in panels that
encompass a range of perspectives and stimulate "crosstalk" among scholars of
different disciplines.  
  
Proposals must include two copies of a one-page abstract and a one-page
curriculum vitae. For proposals submitted as a panel, an abstract and vitae
are required for each panel member. Proposals are due by January 1, 2000. If
you have any questions or would like to be put on the  
mailing list to receive the conference brochure, please contact Charlotte G.
Borst, Chair, Local Arrangements Committee (address below). Conference
materials will be available after August 1, 2000.

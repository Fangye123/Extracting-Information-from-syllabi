## GRADING POLICY

**The course grade will be the average of the letter grades earned in the six
graded exercises noted in the schedule above, minus any penalty that you might
have accumulated as a result of absences and lateness [see policy below]. The
average is calculated by the GPA method [A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0],
and rounded to the closest whole grade. There is no extra credit.**

## Students are expected to sit for examinations with their class. If you miss
an in-class exam, you MUST take the following steps:

  * **Contact the instructor within 24 hours of the scheduled examination time in person, by phone, by e-mail, by voice mail, or via a letter or by message. If you fail to leave any message, it will be assumed that you have left the class, and you will receive a course grade of "F" unless you drop the course prior to the last day of withdrawal. _In short, making prompt contact with the instructor is your responsibility._**
  * **On the first day that you return to class after the scheduled examination time, request permission in writing to make up the examination. A full explanation and documentation of your absence must accompany all requests. Note that vacation or other discretionary travel is not an acceptable excuse for missing any test. Make-up grades will not be available until the day of the Final Exam.**
  * **The instructor reserves the right to either have the student write a make-up test at the Assessment Center in lieu of the missed test, or complete an individualized written assignment instead. In the later case, the individualized written assignment will be due on the last day before Finals week.**

**Students are expected to hand in their Review Essays on the designated day
at the start of class. Review Essays turned in late are penalized one letter
grade for each calendar day [not class day] late. Review Essays turned in on
the due date after the start of class are one day late.**

## ATTENDANCE POLICY

**Regular and punctual attendance is expected. A seating chart will be kept,
and attendance will be noted at the start of class by visual inspection. The
instructor will work out a seating chart based upon your answers to the
student survey.**

**If you are late, it is your responsibility to inform the instructor at the
end of the class sessions. Otherwise, you may be recorded as absent.**

**If you are absent, the cause of the absence is not normally relevant. You
are permitted four days absence from class without penalty. Each absence in
excess of four will reduce your course grade by one letter grade. Exceptions
to the attendance policy will be allowed in cases of severe medical problems
or emergencies of comparable gravity if verifiable documentation is supplied
in a timely fashion, but such exceptions are at the discretion of the
instructor.**

**_Academic Integrity:_**

**NHMCCD is committed to a high standard of academic integrity in the academic
community. In becoming a part of the academic community, students are
responsible for honesty and independent effort. Failure to uphold these
standards includes, but is not limited to, the following: plagiarizing written
work or projects, cheating on exams or assignments, collusion on an exam or
project, and misrepresentation of credentials or prerequisites when
registering for a course. Cheating includes:**

  * **looking at or copying from another student's exam,**
  * **orally communicating or receiving answers during an exam,**
  * **having another person take an exam or complete a project or assignment,**
  * **using unauthorized notes, texts, or other materials for an exam,**
  * **obtaining or distributing an unauthorized copy of an exam or any part of an exam.**

**Plagiarism means passing off as his/her own the ideas or writings of another
(that is, without giving proper credit by documenting sources). Plagiarism
includes submitting a paper, report or project that someone else has prepared,
in whole or in part. Collusion means inappropriate collaboration on
assignments intended for independent competition. These definitions are not
exhaustive. When there is clear evidence of cheating, plagiarism, collusion or
misrepresentation, a faculty member will take disciplinary action.
Disciplinary actions may include, but need not be limited to the following:**

  * **requiring the student to retake or resubmit an exam or assignment**
  * **assigning a grade of zero or "F" for an exam or assignment **
  * **assigning a grade of "F" for the course. **

**Additional sanctions including being withdrawn from the course, program or
expelled from school may be imposed on a student who violates standards of
academic integrity.**

**_Software Piracy:_**

**Law strictly prohibits unauthorized copying of software purchased by Tomball
College for use in laboratories. Tomball College administration will take
appropriate disciplinary action against anyone violating copyright laws.**

**_Computer Virus Protection:_**

**Computer viruses are, unfortunately, a fact of life. Using the diskettes on
more than one computer creates the possibility of infecting computers and
diskettes with a computer virus. This exposes the computers of the college,
your personal computer, and any others you may be using to potentially
damaging viruses. The college has aggressive anti-virus procedures in place to
protect its computers, but cannot guarantee that a virus might not temporarily
infect one of its machines. It is your responsibility to protect all computers
under your control and use and ensure that each diskette you use, whenever or
wherever you use it, has been scanned with anti-virus software. Since new
viruses arise continually, your anti-virus software must be kept current. And,
since no anti-virus software will find every virus, keeping copies of data
(backups) is extremely important.**

**_Guaranteed Graduate Policy:_**

**North Harris Montgomery Community College District guarantees that graduates
of its Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, or Associate of Applied
Science and all Certificate programs, providing under certain circumstances,
additional education and training tuition free to students lacking appropriate
mastery of specified competencies. For additional information, refer to the
NHMCCD college catalog.**

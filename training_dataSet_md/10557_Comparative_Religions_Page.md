"Although there are several different subject areas on the culture page, the
one for "Religion/Spirituality" is the one that is of great use to our class.
The section has a fair, unbiased informational approach to more than a dozen
different major religious groups in the world today, along with some humor and
general encouragement. The areas on the different religious entities are all
fair, balanced, and informative, covering the formation, history, primary
beliefs, traditions, size, sacred texts and other teaching tools" [Louis
Anderson].

Tolerance  "This site sets itself apart from most that one will find on the
web where religious sites are concerned. This is a site devoted to a
nonjudgemental, pragmatic approach to dozens of major religions, & pseudo-
religions, around the world. They make no judgements about any of the
organizations they examine, they simply present the teachings, history,
supporting and problematic "situations" and thoughts for each." [Louis
Anderson]

American Interfaith Network "The web site of an organization working to
promote understanding and discussion among the the various religious
traditions within the North American landscape.  The site offers links to a
large number of religious traditions in North America, news on discussion and
work among various traditions, and a library of essays on interfaith
dialogue."  [Wes Jamison]

Calendar  "This site is one with a different approach to religious study, but
one which can certainly serve to stimulate the interest of the visitor. This
site contains calendars for the current year, as well as several years to
come, that have the "Primary Sacred Times" for many religions around the
world. A nice, unique approach to introducing students to other religious
organizations."  [Louis Anderson]

**Goals:** This course seeks to examine the interrelationships between
education and democracy, with particular attention to issues involving
cultural literacy, language - words - and power, morality and education, and
the role and function of the individual as related to self and to society.

In the process, the course seeks to enhance students' abilities to

  * communicate both orally and in writing
  * better understand the relationships between their individual voices and the substantive issues examined
  * describe the differences and similarities in approaches to problem solving of writers and scholars from a variety of fields
  * identify the values that shape the practice, applications, and communications in various fields of writing and/or research
  * explain the criteria and evidence used to determine whether a theory or idea is accepted or rejected
  * give evidence of multidisciplinary inquiry and applications in their own work

**Responsibilities:**

  * Attendance - because of the seminar format of the course, no more than one absence is allowed. 
  * Weekly essays - The sharing of weekly essays, written in response to the assigned readings, will promote development of your written and oral skills, independent thinking, and group discussion. These essays should grow naturally out of your work on "Analytical Questions for Readings" and must be submitted electronically to the entire class no later than noon on the day preceding our actual class meeting. 
  * Final Paper - A final paper (5-7 pages), to be developed from the essays and discussions, will challenge you to present in a coherent fashion and in your own individual voice your grasp of selected aspects of the issues discussed. Note: I do not expect the paper to be a major research project. However, I do expect it to show some good awareness of and reference to at least a couple of secondary sources. Topics are up to you but subject to my approval. (For those who have difficulty coming up with topics, I can always make suggestions.) 

Papers will be graded on intent, content, reasoning, language, neatness,
effort, accuracy. Five points to keep in mind: 1) develop a thesis statement,
2) discuss the main points covered in readings and in class discussions and
make connections with the thesis, 3) incorporate relevant evidence to prove
thesis, 4) make connections among related concepts, ideas, and events, 5)
reach a conclusion based on the analysis of the evidence.

**Grades:** based on class participation, in-class papers, weekly essays, and
final paper

**Analytical Questions for Readings**

I. Reading the work and understanding the author

  * Definitions. List words and terms that need discussion. 
  * Major themes and key points (of the **author** \--your own ideas will come later). For example, what is the claim? Is it an interpretation? a position on a controversial issue? a proposal for the solution of a complex problem? How is the claim developed? What values is the author applying? Is (s)he approaching this as a question of truth, opinion, or disciplinary clarification? How is (s)he thinking about this subject? Highlight points you feel need discussion.

II. Analyzing the author's thoughts

  * Summarize the argument 
    * What's the problem, issue or question being addressed? 
    * What words are used to describe the problem precisely? 
    * Why is (s)he doing this? 
    * What will (s)he do with the conclusions?
  * Evaluate the strength of the evidence. (These are **your** statements). 
    * What's the author's prior knowledge and experience? 
    * Source of data? (subject to bias?) 
    * Are interpretations and judgements firmly grounded in work of others? 
    * Would you rate claims as true/correct? untrue? plausible? 
    * Is there anything that prevents you from saying whether the claims are true? What? 
    * What specific additional data/information do you need?
  * Decisions - burden of proof 
    * What's your judgement of this work? What points will you accept or reject? Why? 
    * In what ways would you have approached the task differently? 
III. Importance and Integration: How important is this article? How well does
it relate to course themes and materials?

**Weekly Essays**

This course requires each of you to submit a 2-page essay for each week's
assignment and to read everyone else's essays for the week prior to coming to
class. The three-fold purpose of this sharing is to  
  

  * promote a professional environment of constructive criticism 
  * encourage responsible, serious and professional commentary 
  * make it possible for students to follow up one another's comments and engage in further discussion privately or collectively 

The selection process below allows you to submit your own essays and to read
those submitted by classmates. Simply click the appropriate choice.

Note: this process functions only for students who are registered for this
course and have been assigned a course password.

Usually, my evaluative comments about these essays will be addressed on an
individual basis, thus safeguarding privacy and student sensitivity while also
allowing the individual to forward those comments to classmates as (s)he sees
fit. However, when I believe that my comments to an individual will be helpful
to all students, I will post them under [Prof.'s Comments](ProfComments.html),
which you should check periodically.

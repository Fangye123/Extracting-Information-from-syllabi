> Until the 1970s there were hardly any women film directors in Germany. Today
there are proportionally more than in any other film-making country, and their
work has been extremely influential. Films made by German women directors
since the mid-1970s present a body of work that cannot be ignored; nor for
that matter can the work of Leni Riefenstahl in the 1930s, although no
feminist would want to claim her work for Nazis as feminist film. Directors
like Leontine Sagan, Helke Sander, Ulrike Ottinger, Jutta Bruckner, Margarethe
von Trotta, and Monika Treut have made a huge contribution to feminist film
culture, but until now critics of the German Cinema have focused almost
exclusively on male directors such as Lang, Fassbinder and Wenders. We will
examine how restrictive social, economic, and institutional conditions have
compounded the neglect of women directors. We will explore the principal
characteristics of women's film-making, and ask about the importance of the
women's movement for West German films by women, the concern with the notion
of a "feminine aesthetic," women's entry into the mainstream, and the
emergence of a so-called post-feminist cinema.

>

> In this course, we will cover a wide variety of films. Politically, they
range from the anti-authoritarian _Girls in Uniform_ , made just before the
Nazi era, to Marianne Rosenbaum's pacifist film _Peppermint Peace_ (1983) made
at the height of the West German peace movement, from Leni Riefenstahl's
notorious propaganda film for the Nazis _Triumph of the Will_ (1935) to Monika
Treut's _The Virgin Machine_ (1988) promoting sexual choice . In terms of
style, they range from the relative conventional _Marianne and Juliane_ (1981)
by Margarethe von Trotta to the much more experimental director Helke Sander
with her film _REDUPERS_ (1977), and from Jutta Br uckner's narrative film
_Years of Hunger_ (1979) to the surrealistic _Ticket of No Return_ (1979) by
Ulrike Ottinger.

>

> Because we are fortunate enough to have film maker Monika Treut with us this
semester, we will be focusing on her films, and we will be able to hear and
learn more about the production side of German filmmaking. Ms. Treut will be
an important resource for the course.

>

> The course aims to examine the films within the larger socio-historical
context in Germany. Since **this is a culture studies course** , we will
analyze 20th century German history, politics, and culture by looking at
German films. Films by German women directors make up a body of work that
cannot be ignored in any discussion of German cinema. In turn, filmmaking by
women in the 1970s and 1980s cannot be examined without taking into account
feminism's "second wave" in Western Europe and the U.S. Nor can film theory be
examined without looking at feminist film theory. In this course we will talk
about the fundamentals of film analysis and contemporary film criticism, so
that the formal structures of the films can be understood. By the end of the
course, students should be able both to do a "close reading" of a film and to
place it within the larger historical context defined by the aesthetic and
political debates in West German society to which the films respond.

**Goals and Approach:**

    
    
    The purpose of this course is to introduce you to events and changes
    
    
    bearing on the religious, social and cultural complexion of Europe that unfolded
    
    
    in later 17th and 18th centuries. Traditionally historians think of this time span as
    
    
    encompassing the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment and the Age of Absolutism,
    
    
    but our focus will chiefly be on the Enlightenment in France, the British Isles,
    
    
    German speaking Europe and the Dutch Republic.  However one decides to name it, the ideas
    
    
    that took root in Europe in this period are still very much with us today,
    
    
    and not just in so-called Western society.  Here are some of them: freedom of the press,
    
    
    freedom of expression, secularism, atheism, equality between peoples, classes and genders,
    
    
    representative democracy, evolution, cultural relativism, separation of church and
    
    
    state, romanticism. . . I will stop here as the list is long indeed.



    
    
    As you might imagine with so many ideas floating about, historians have had a difficult time
    
    
    deciding what the Enlightenment, at its heart, was.  While we will not come up with any
    
    
    definitive answers this term, we will try to look at the merits of seeing the Enlightenment
    
    
    from several perspectives.  We will  look at those who created and promoted
    
    
    the Enlightenment's chief ideas (though not all of them), which is the approach of the
    
    
    intellectual historian. Among the thinkers we will encounter are Kant, Hume, Rousseau
    
    
    and Diderot.  Another level at which we will look at the Enlightenment involves looking
    
    
    at the people who were involved with the ideas of the Enlightenment but were not among its
    
    
    most famous exponents.  Most of these people came from the professional and commercial
    
    
    classes.  The great mass of Europe's population (we will focus mainly on France, the
    
    
    British Isles, German speaking Europe and the Netherlands) will also come under scrutiny.
    
    
    I hope too that we will be able to see the Enlightenment not just as a collection of important
    
    
    but "dead" ideas but also as a living attitude of mind.



    
    
    In this course we will strive to grapple with all of the many facets of the Enlightenment
    
    
    with an eye towards gaining a greater understanding not only of the European past but also
    
    
    of ourselves and the society in which we currently live.  As I place a particular emphasis both
    
    
    on written and oral expression, it is also my hope that you will each improve your abilities
    
    
    in these areas as well.



    
    
    **Ideal Environment:**
    
    
    The heart of the class-room environment (for me) rests in respect, enthusiasm,
    
    
    and openness. This may sound general, so I will elaborate. Enthusiasm means a
    
    
    persistent willingness to tackle the problems that come up in the readings and
    
    
    assignments for each week. It does not mean that everyone always has to show up
    
    
    happy and cheerful, but readiness to make a contribution to class is a must.
    
    
    Respect in the classroom means valuing each person's participation, not
    
    
    because their ideas are the best (although you might think so), but because
    
    
    he or she is trying to make a contribution to the group. Openness lies in
    
    
    the freedom for people to express their thoughts and opinions, which includes
    
    
    scope for debate and disagreement with me or anyone else. The closer we
    
    
    approach this ideal environment, the more the classroom will be an effective
    
    
    space for clarifying, making manageable and even experimenting with the issues
    
    
    confronted in the course. This ideal may not always be achievable, but in my
    
    
    view we should always strive for it.



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    


    
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    
    Course work consists of four elements: participation in discussion, informal
    
    
    writings, formal writings, and an essay-based examination.



    
    
    **Participation:**
    
    
    a. Preparation: In order to understand the lectures and participate in class
    
    
    discussions and other activities you will need to do the assigned readings.
    
    
    Please budget time to complete readings for the date in which they appear in
    
    
    the assignment and reading schedule. The readings are in two forms, which
    
    
    are listed below.



> **Major Secondary Works:**  
>  Robert Darnton, _The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French
Cultural_  
> _History_ (New York: Random House Inc., 1985)

>

> Thomas Munck, _The Enlightenment: A Comparative Social History 1721-1794_  
>  (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000)

>

> **Primary Sources:**

>

> Denis Diderot, _The Nun_ , translated by Leonard Tancock (New York, Penguin
Putnam Inc., 1974)

>

> _Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader_ , edited by Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze
(Malden, MA:  
> Blackwell Publishers Inc., 1997)

>

> Jean-Jaques Rousseau, _The Social Contract and Discourses_ (North Clarendon,
VT: Tuttle Publishing, 1993)

>

> Susan Vreeland, _The Girl in Hyacinth Blue_ (New York, Penguin Putnam Inc.,
2000)

>

> Additional source hand-outs and readings as needed  
>  
    
    
    All of the above readings will be required for the course and are available at
    
    
    the CU bookstore. _The Enlightenment: A Comparative Social History 1721-1794_
    
    
    provides a broad overview of the main issues in the course.  The other works,
    
    
    of which one is a secondary work, another a novel and the other three primary sources,
    
    
    are intended to give you snapshots of particular  contexts and will allow us to
    
    
    become familiar with historical processes at first  hand.  When necessary I will
    
    
    supplement these readings with short source readings,  usually taken from online
    
    
    resources.



    
    
    **b. Discussion:** This may seem like a small thing and something unrelated
    
    
    to the real stuff (passing the exams and hammering out the papers).
    
    
    As this is an upper division course, however, I want to stress that
    
    
    participation in discussion **will count heavily** in your grade and that active
    
    
    participation often improves performance in the pressure situations.
    
    
    In general, I will gauge participation on a daily basis with a check,
    
    
    check-plus, check-minus system.



    
    
    **c. Informal Writings:** Occasionally I may assign short writing exercises
    
    
    to help focus our discussions. The emphasis will vary from paper to paper.
    
    
    Informal writings will also be graded with a check, check-plus, check-minus
    
    
    system and include comments.



    
    
    **d. Enlightenment Reading Quiz:** For the next several weeks we will be reading
    
    
    Thomas Munck, _The Enlightenment: A Comparative Social History, 1721-1794_.   This
    
    
    book will be our main overview of the most important issues in the course.  On
    
    
    completing our reading of the book you will take a fairly extensive quiz (it should
    
    
    last an entire hour) over what you have read.  As it is a reading quiz, I will make
    
    
    available all of the questions on this quiz in advance.  Most of the questions will
    
    
    be factual with a minimum of interpretation.  Learning the answers to them
    
    
    should give us all a common vocabulary with which we will be able to discuss
    
    
    the other books in the course on a more or less equal footing.  At this point, my
    
    
    plan is to issue questions on a weekly or semi-weekly basis that you should prepare
    
    
    for class discussion.  A selection of these questions will then appear on the reading
    
    
    quiz on **February .**   The quiz will be part of your participation grade and **is worth**
    
    
    **5% of the total grade.**



    
    
    **e. Credit for Participation:** Informal writing(s), class discussion and the reading
    
    
    quiz **will be worth 20%** of the final grade.   I will count each day you show up in class
    
    
    and each informal writing as one participation measurement for which you can receive up
    
    
    to 10 points.  To have a fair shot at an A in participation you must have a minimum of 28
    
    
    measurements or a potential to receive 280 points.  If you have less than 28 measurements,
    
    
    then your participation grade will naturally suffer.  In addition to these points, as noted
    
    
    above 25% of the participation grade will be earned by taking the reading quiz outlined
    
    
    above.



    
    
    **Reaction Papers: ** You will have to write three focused essays/reaction
    
    
    papers.  Each paper will account for about 20% of your total grade, **but**
    
    
    **with particular attention paid to the degree to which people**
    
    
    **improve over course of the term.   **Due dates for the papers are listed
    
    
    below. [General](http://www.cameron.edu/~dougc/standardspage.htm) and specific guidelines for the papers will be provided in this
    
    
    syllabus.



    
    
    **Examinations: ** There will be one examination worth 20% of the total grade.
    
    
    This will be an end of term examination and will likely be a mixture of essays
    
    
    and matching questions.  Guidelines for the grading standards that apply to
    
    
    written work done for this class may be found by clicking on the [hypertext](http://www.cameron.edu/~dougc/gradingcriteria.htm)
    
    
    in this sentence.
    
    
    **Guidelines for Academic Work:**
    
    
    **Late Papers:** The following policy applies to all late papers for this course that will receive
    
    a letter grade.  All papers submitted at any time on the day that the paper is due will be
    
    considered on time.  Papers submitted after that date, no matter what the reason may be, will
    
    be automatically marked down one grade.  You will then have ten days from the original due date
    
    to turn in the paper, during which time no further penalty for lateness will be incurred.
    
    
    If in that time you are unable to complete the work, the paper will receive a zero.



    
    
    **Late Informal Writings:** No late informal writings will be accepted, so don't ask.   Remember,
    
    
    though, that your participation grade is a composite of your performance in class  and your
    
    
    performance  on informal writings.  As long as you manage to achieve a total of  28
    
    
    measurements, it will not matter to me how you do so.  Although I will obviously keep track of
    
    
    what you do by way of participation I would advise you to remain aware of where you stand for
    
    
    yourself so that you know whether or not you are achieving the necessary minimum level of
    
    
    participation.



    
    
    **Missed Examinations:** As noted above, there is a final examination for this course.
    
    
    Makeup's for the final examination will be allowed only under extraordinary circumstances
    
    
    and the nature of any make-up final given will be determined at my discretion.



    
    
    **Plagiarism:** Plagiarism is the representation of the work of another as
    
    
    your own. In all of the writing you do for this course you must make clear
    
    
    to me which ideas in a paper are your own and which come from someone else.
    
    
    This is especially important for any formal essays you write. In these such
    
    
    essays you must cite all primary and secondary sources you use in accordance
    
    
    with the proper conventions. I will provide a sheet explaining the basics of
    
    
    citation before any formal essays come due. If for some reason you do not
    
    
    receive a copy of this hand-out, do not assume you will be exempt from following
    
    
    its guidelines as it will be available on the online syllabus. In cases of
    
    
    plagiarism, the Department of History and Government at CU  follows the
    
    
    plagiarism policy in the 2000-2001 "Student Handbook," pp. 207-211.  Please heed
    
    
    this warning.

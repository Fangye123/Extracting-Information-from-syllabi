## Course Description

This course is designed to introduce you to analytical and critical writing,
forms of writing which you will be expected to be able to produce at the
University level. As the title of this course suggests, this introduction to
university-level writing will be accomplished by focusing on various topics in
the general field of social and political philosophy. We will spend time
critically reading articles in order to try to understand both how the author
uses argument and evidence in an effort to establish her thesis and how these
articles work as a whole. As a result, we will carefully look at the variety
and forms of argumentation, and we also will practice locating, extracting and
analyzing the arguments presented in these articles.

Throughout this course, the emphasis will be on your own writing. You will be
writing to explore, to understand, and to evaluate the readings we will
discuss in class. The assignments and general structure of the course are
intended to both facilitate your comprehension of the material and to help you
become clear, careful academic writers. Further, since revision is a
substantial and vital part of the writing process, you will be asked to write
a series of critical papers of varying lengths, and these papers and the ideas
presented in them will be under constant revision.

## Policies

All assignments _must_ be finished and turned in on time. Late assignments
will be marked down 1/3 of a grade for each day (not class session) that they
are late.

_Attendance_ : For this course, it is imperative that you come to class
regularly and that you come to class prepared to be engaged actively with the
material. As a result, I do require that you come to class, and I will be
keeping track of who is missing each day. Repeated or excessive absences will
result in your grade being lowered.

_Participation_ : Participation will be a significant part of this course.
Participation includes coming to class prepared and ready to discuss the day's
material, contributing to class discussions, sharing your opinions in small
group discussions, and workshopping with your peers. This means that you must
have read the assigned material and spent some time sorting through, and
trying to better understand, the material before you come to class.

_Plagiarism_ : When you use another person's work or idea, you must properly
document that you have done so. Lack of documentation or improper
documentation are forms of plagiarism, and no form of plagiarism will be
tolerated in this class. We will talk more in class about how to document your
sources properly. If you are caught plagiarizing on an assignment in this
class you automatically will fail that assignment.

_Rewrites:_ For this course you are allowed to hand in an additional rewrite
for two of the papers (i.e., each of the first two critical papers). You will
be limited to _one_ rewrite per assignment, and in order to increase your
grade you must have done some _substantial_ revision. In order to encourage
this, I am also requiring that you set up an appointment with me to discuss
the revision prior to your handing it in. Again, this is required in order to
increase your grade on the assignment which you are revising. In this meeting
we will discuss your ideas for revision, additional revision strategies,
target some areas of the paper which could be improved, etc. If you have any
other questions about this, please talk to me.

## Important Free Help

_College Writing Center_ : The CWC, located in Rush Rhees G-121 (in the CLARC
tunnel), offers free writing tutoring. They will not proofread your essay, but
they will help you with general questions regarding content, style, etc. Call
273-3577 and make an appointment, and call early because appointments fill
quickly. This is an extremely valuable resource; so please take advantage of
it!

Also, I should emphasize that I encourage you to contact me if you have any
questions. If you have any concerns about the course or you would like to
discuss your work, feel free to contact me or to stop by my office during
office hours.

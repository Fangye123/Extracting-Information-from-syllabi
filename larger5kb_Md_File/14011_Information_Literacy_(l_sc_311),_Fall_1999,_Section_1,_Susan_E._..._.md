## USENET & DejaNews

* * *

### USENET: What is it?

Usenet remains one of the least commercial and wide-ranging "regions" of the
Internet. More than the web, Usenet, along with email, can build "virtual
communities" \-- people drawn together by common interests who may never meet,
but who share information, stories, advice, etc.

One way of gaining access to Usenet newsgroups is via your DANTE account.
Instead of typing "pine" at the **DANTE%** prompt, type **tin** instead. This
will log you into the University's USENET reader program.

  * ^F ^B--down (^B = up) one page

Usenet Newsgroups can also be accessed through the Web via [ Deja
News](http://www.dejanews.com). This method takes advantage of the Netscape
browser viewing and printing characteristics and provides access to a larger
number of Newsgroups. Dejanews began in March 1995 and has kept an archive of
all messages sent through the free service since then.

### Arrangement, Categories and Names of Newsgroups

The names assigned to newsgroups are hierarchical, just like call numbers in
the Library of Congress classification scheme. The name is a series of words
or abbreviations separated by periods. These move from general to specific as
the abbreviations move from left to right. The highest level of the hierarchy
is usually common to the entire Usenet system, such as alt and rec. For a
comprehensive list of the hierarchies, visit [Master List of Newsgroup
Hierarchies](http://home.magmacom.com/~leisen/master_list.html) at
<http://home.magmacom.com/~leisen/master_list.html>

**Examples:**  
**rec.outdoors.fishing.saltwater** (rec. is for groups that relate to artistic
activities, hobbies and other recreations)  
**news.answers** (news. is for information that applies to all newsgroups,
such as rules of etiquette)  
**alt.fan.leo-dicaprio** (alt. is for alternative topics)  
**misc.invest.stocks** (misc. is for miscellaneous)  
**comp.answers** (comp. is for computer-related topics)  
**soc.romance** (soc. is for socially-oriented lists)

* * *

###  Definitions

**Archives** : most newsgroups maintain archives of their postings, so those
who are new can catch up and those who are looking for something specific can
find it.

**Article:** an individual newsgroup message.

**Cross-posting** : posting an article to more than one newsgroup.

**FAQs** : Frequently Asked Questions are a compiled list of the most commonly
asked questions posed to, discussed in or related to a newsgroup. These are
found on the newsgroup, at news.answers or at h[ttp://www.cis.ohio-
state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html](http://www.cis.ohio-
state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html) (highly selective).

**Network News Transport Protocol or NNTP** : the language, means of
communication or protocol for exchanging and managing Usenet news.

**Newsgroup or Usenet newsgroup or IDG (Internet Discussion Group)** : a free
Internet discussion group (interest group, mailing list) that posts messages
on a specific topic (and theoretically exclusively on that topic). They first
appeared in 1979. The messages are not posted and received through email, but
rather to the newsgroup area maintained on the Internet and available through
ISPs and universities. Newsgroups are useful because they help you receive
information on a topic or obtain an answer to a question from all over the
Internet. They help you connect with people who are interested in the same
things you are. They also provide an opportunity to publish creative writing,
opinions, advice and gossip. According to [ Dejanews
](http://w2.dejanews.com/info/idg.shtml)
(http://w2.dejanews.com/info/idg.shtml), newsgroups are "an electronic
community of people interacting with each other." Messages posted to
newsgroups may be read by thousands of people all over the world. Most
newsgroups are maintained by **volunteers** interested in the topic.

**Newsreader** : a software program that runs on a personal computer. It
enables someone to read and participate in discussion forums via the Internet.
You use the newsreader program to interact (read and post messages) with the
newsgroup. It also keeps track of the newsgroups you have joined and
individual messages you have viewed. It is the equivalent of the web browser,
but for newsgroups. Major browsers often contain a newsreader.

**Post or Posting:** composing either an original article or a response to
someone else's article and then publishing it to the newsgroup's area.

**Thread or threads** : all the articles that respond to a particular
question, minor topic or issue posed on the newsgroup. Thread is the
appropriate descriptive term because one follows the topic as its coverage
weaves through the correspondence on the newsgroup.

**Usenet** : a system for exchanging messages called **articles** arranged
according to specific categories called **newsgroups**. It is a large and
rapidly changing community of individuals who communicate over the Internet
according to an agreed-upon code of etiquette.

###  Finding Newsgroups

The following newsgroups list new groups as they are added to Usenet:
news.answers, news.lists and news.groups.

The following websites feature lists of newsgroups:   [Deja
News](http://www.dejanews.com/), http://www.dejanews.com |  [Liszt of
Newsgroups](http://www.liszt.com/news), http://www.liszt.com/news |
[Tile.net/news](http://tile.net/news), http://tile.net/news  
---|---|---  
  
* * *

### Information about Newsgroups

Vital information about newsgroups and how they work is contained in actual
newsgroups. Consult the following groups before posting your first message:

###   news.announce.newgroups |  How to establish a newsgroup and lists of
recently added newsgroups  
---|---  
 news.announce.newusers |   **Go here first** : background articles and
information to help you understand and use newsgroups effectively. "A Primer
on How to Work with the Usenet Community" is most helpful to beginners.  
 news.answers |  FAQs and other basic questions answered  
 news.newusers.questions |  Exactly what the name implies  
  
* * *

### Searching Newsgroups

Four of the general Internet search engines we have already used will also
search newsgroups.

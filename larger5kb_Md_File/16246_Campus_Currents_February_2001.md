> ## Wanda Russo donates $1 million to Fairfield University

>

> _By Nancy C. Lilley, Media Relations Specialist_

>

> Mrs. Wanda Russo of Fairfield has made a $1 million gift to Fairfield
University to honor the memory of her late husband, Robert D. Russo, Sr., M.D.
Dr. Russo was the former chairman of the Department of Radiology at St.
Vincent's Medical Center and served as a member of the University's Board of
Trustees.

>

> _University President Rev. Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J. has announced that
Fairfield will establish the Robert D. Russo, Sr. Scholarship Fund in
recognition of Mrs.Wanda Russo's $1 million gift._  
> ---|---  
>  
> In recognition of the gift, the University will establish the Robert D.
Russo, Sr. Scholarship Fund for pre-med students who otherwise would not have
the financial resources to attend Fairfield.

>

> "The University is fortunate to have had such a long and valued friendship
with the Russo family," said University President Rev. Aloysius P. Kelley,
S.J. upon the announcement made last month. The gift is part of [**"Our
Promise: The Campaign for Fairfield
University,"**](http://www.fairfield.edu/calendar/webfeatures/campaign00/) the
comprehensive $100 million fundraising effort announced in September.

>

> Fr. Kelley added, "I could not be more pleased to have Bob's name so visibly
and permanently associated with Fairfield and the education of future
generations of doctors. I only hope they will become the kind of people,
personally and professionally, that he was."

>

> Fairfield has nearly 200 pre-med students presently enrolled. They take the
majority of their classes in the Rudolph F. Bannow Science Center, which is
currently being expanded by a $15 million addition. The Russo Scholars
especially will benefit from this enhanced science center, which will house
five new labs and multimedia classrooms with the latest technology.

>

> Dr. Russo, who died in 1999, was a longtime friend and benefactor of the
University. Among the many contributions he and his wife made were the altar
and some of the stained glass windows in the Egan Chapel of St. Ignatius
Loyola. A graduate of Fordham and Georgetown Universities, he always credited
his Jesuit education with giving him values to live by and for fostering his
lifelong love of learning.

>

> Mrs. Russo reflected, "Bob would be very, very happy with this gift to the
University since he became so involved at its inception and held it in such
high regard. He was extremely education-oriented and wanted to see the school
grow. In addition, he was very fond of Father Kelley and greatly admired the
job Father has done for the University and the community."

>

> Dr. Russo built a distinguished 47-year career as a radiologist but he
always loved to teach. He kept pace with his rapidly expanding field by
founding the education center at St. Vincent's, which is responsible for the
continuing education of staff and doctors. He brought his love of teaching to
Fairfield University where he served on the Board of Trustees from 1988 to
1994 and also on its Student Affairs Committee.

>

> In addition, Dr. Russo was past president of the Medical Staff at St.
Vincent's Medical Center, past president of the Connecticut State Radiology
Society, a member of the Eastern Society of Radiologists, and a Fellow of the
American College of Radiology.

>

> He was a founder and former board member of the Lafayette Bank and Trust
Company, and served on the Board of Trustees of St. Vincent's Medical Center
and the United Illuminating Company.

>

> Dr. Russo was also a Knight of St. Gregory, and a major supporter of the
American Red Cross and the City of Bridgeport. The park located at the
intersection of Washington and Park Avenues in Bridgeport is named in his
honor.

>

> Dr. Russo's son, Dr. Bob Russo, Jr., who followed his father's path into
medicine as well as his specialty of radiology, added, "This gift is so
appropriate to honor my father's memory because education was his passion, not
only for his own children but also for his co-workers." Dr. Russo, Jr. noted
that his father founded several technological schools at St. Vincent's
including diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and magnetic
resonance imaging. In addition, more than 100 physicians have graduated from
his Radiology Residence Program.

>

> In fact, Dr. Russo was so committed to education that his children, Richard,
Arlyne, and Bob Jr., said there were two phrases their father often used to
sum up his own philosophy: "There is no substitute for daily preparation,"
and, "Fame and fortune may come and go, but no one can ever take away your
education."

>

> ## Campus Pipeline to offer expanded services to faculty, staff

>

> _By Jill Kasiewicz, Editor_

>

> With most students and faculty already plugged in to [**Campus
Pipeline**](https://campus.fairfield.edu/cp/home/loginf), Vice President for
Information Services James Estrada is looking to roll out access to University
staff, administration, and alumni throughout the spring semester.

>

> "Although some University employees have had accounts since September, what
they have been able to access has been limited," said Estrada. "This semester,
more staff will get accounts, and additional features will be available."

>

> These will include ways for users to personalize their Campus Pipeline Web
Pages by having customized content delivered daily to their web home base
pages.

>

> Estrada sees Campus Pipeline as a more efficient way for staff and
administration to access data already found in Banner. "Campus Pipeline
extracts the rich information from Banner and allows the user to get at it
more easily."

>

> For faculty, Campus Pipeline "will cut out steps" in many paper-and-pencil
systems. For example, Estrada explained, faculty advisors will be able to
approve - on-line and almost instantaneously - students interested in taking a
course with prerequisites. With student permission, advisors can - without
leaving their desks - look up a student record to see if the appropriate
courses have been taken, and electronically "approve" entrance to a particular
class.

>

> Faculty can also post grades on Campus Pipeline - a feature that may make
traditional grade books a thing of the past. According to Estrada, many
students logged on to Campus Pipeline during the last week in December just to
check their semester grades.

>

> The University Registrar's office has incorporated Campus Pipeline into its
regular activities since last semester, when all students who wanted to
register online had to do so through a Campus Pipeline account. Most did. "We
expect to be at nearly one hundred percent usage this semester," Estrada said.

>

> Kevin Clancy, account executive for SCT, said that there are more than 3500
University members currently using Campus Pipeline. "Christmas week alone,
there were more than 2000 people logging in. With an Internet account and a
Campus Pipeline account, you could log in from anywhere in the world."

>

> Internet speed has received a lot of attention since last semester. Estrada
is hopeful that with the installation of a fractional T3 line by July 1, slow
connections will be a thing of the past. "The University has doubled its
capacity twice now," he said. "In April 2000, we went from one T1 line to two,
and in November, that was increased to four T1s. With bandwidth quickly
reaching capacity, we are striving to stay ahead of the need for greater
network bandwidth by scheduling upgrades on an annual basis. The next upgrade
will provide a significant enhancement to our network's capacity."

>

> **Some of Pipeline's features (current and to come):**

>

> **For faculty**

>

>   * Post grades

>   * View class rosters, student records (with permission)

>   * Set up class chat rooms

>   * Create distribution lists

>   * Post course syllabus

>   * Link to sites related to course material

>   * Facilitate student advisement

>

> **For staff**

>

>   * Access Banner information faster, in a more user-friendly system

>   * Monitor institutional performance

>   * View paycheck history

>

> **For students**

>

>   * Register for courses

>   * View grades

>   * Facilitate advisement with faculty

> ## Doris Stan and Steve Jakab: Reflections as they retire

>

> _By Barbara D. Kiernan, Director of University Publications_

>

> Two long-time Fairfield administrators, Doris Stan and Steve Jakab, retired
on February 1, but not without first sharing some reflections on their
respective tenures and lessons learned.

>

> **Doris Stan**

>

> Doris Stan leaves Fairfield University after 23 years of service, first as a
(very overqualified) secretary, then a grants writer, and later as director of
grants and sponsored programs. In 1997, added responsibilities earned her yet
another promotion, and she was named assistant to the academic vice president.

>

> ![DorisStan](Images/DorisStan.JPG)  
> _Photo by Jean Santopatre_  
> _Doris Stan_  
> ---  
>  
> A self-described "generalist," she loved the variety of faculty,
administrators, and academic disciplines she dealt with, as together they
worked to secure the caliber of grants that would give Fairfield a platform
for transformation, and its faculty the means to further their research and
scholarly contributions.

>

> Stan was "discovered" soon after she, her husband Allan, and their five
children moved to Connecticut from New Jersey. At the time that her youngest
was edging toward kindergarten age, one of her new neighbors thought Stan
would be a perfect secretary for her husband, who was provost at Fairfield
University (right across the street). With the understanding that being his
secretary would be a starting point, she began working for Dr. John Barone in
1978. "As I look back, I realize he saw something in me that I was not yet
aware of. He became a great and supportive mentor, and taught me many valuable
lessons."

>

> Two she particularly remembers are: 1) not to live off the glory of 10
minutes ago (in other words, celebrate success but then keep moving forward)
and 2) never, ever to disparage yourself. "Dr. Barone heard me say one time,
after I had made a mistake, something like, 'Oh, how stupid of me.' He
immediately called me on the fact that I had put myself down, and I've never
forgotten it," she says.

>

> While working full-time, Stan earned a master's degree from the former
Graduate School of Corporate and Political Communication at Fairfield, just
one avenue through which she says contact with the Jesuits and their tradition
of openness gradually changed her way of thinking. "I think especially of Fr.
[John] Schmotzer," she says, "who was so far ahead of his time in
understanding that negotiation had to be based on respect for the fact that we
are a global village. I came in somewhat oblivious to the stereotypes of
others that I had. Through the Jesuit focus on the value and dignity of "the
other," something kicked in and reshaped the way I think about things."

>

> A point of particular satisfaction to Stan is the success and growth of the
Humanities Institute which was established through an NEH Challenge Grant,
awarded in 1983. The endowed fund has grown from the original $1 million to
more than $2 million and returned about $1 million to the University for
faculty development and other much needed projects.

>

> A news and trends junkie, Stan reads broadly and voluminously to stay
current with the national and international scene, an activity she looks
forward to doing at a less frenetic pace now that she has retired. Of
Fairfield University she reflects, "We have a very able faculty today who, in
applying for grants, are extremely competitive at the national level. By
cultivating relationships, they are developing some exciting cross-
disciplinary alliances that a school of Fairfield's size best fosters. I
expect good things from them and for Fairfield. What it requires is what it
has always required - a willingness to go the extra mile."

>

> **Steve Jakab**

>

> Steve Jakab, by now, has most likely moved beyond what he was calling, just
three weeks ago, "anticipatory anxiety." The latter he attributes to "the
marvel of Fairfield," where from his perspective as Associate Vice President
for Human Resources, he has seen the good that people have done - often
behind-the-scenes with no public notice - and the ways in which the
administration has supported that. "The fact that Fairfield operates from the
heart, I attribute to the Jesuits," says Jakab. "The foundation they set and
have built upon is what sets Fairfield apart. That I was able to be part of it
I will carry with me always."

>

> ![SteveJakab](Images/SteveJakab.JPG)  
> _Photo by Jean Santopatre_  
> _Steve Jakab_  
> ---  
>  
> When he first became Director of Personnel and Employee Relations, all
administrative offices were located in Canisius Hall. "It made communication a
lot easier," he says with a laugh, "and saved a lot of time that we now spend
playing phone tag and scheduling meetings. But it's one of the prices that
comes with growth and increased professionalism."

>

> "The best part for me is that I've been able to help some people with
difficult life situations, and others get to places in their careers that they
wanted to go," he reflects. Of course, he's seen his share of the downside as
well, trying to prevent a career or life situation from skidding down the
wrong track. "Sometimes I gave people too much rope," he muses, "but I'd
rather have erred that way than give up on a person too soon."

>

> Jakab points to moments along the way that he counts as among his most
satisfying. In 1981, there was the Employer of the Year Award given to
Fairfield University for its practice of hiring people with disabilities for
jobs appropriate to their abilities (a program now in its 19th year). "Giving
people a chance has always been one of my avocations," says Jakab, who has
been active on the boards and committees of the Guenster Rehabilitation
Center, Goodwill, the Red Cross, and the Kennedy Center.

>

> In 1997, another deeply satisfying kudo came Jakab's way when, based on the
quality of Fairfield's employee programs and benefits, the University was
named one of the nation's Top 29 Family Friendly university and college
employers in the Chronicle of Higher Education. In 1998, he was honored by the
Alumni Association and received its Distinguished Administrator of the Year
award.

>

> "Fairfield is on a roll," he observes, looking out the window of the office
he is about to vacate. "There's so much good energy here, so much room to do
more good, and so many good people to help make it possible. I've been blessed
to be supported by my wonderful family, to work with the finest people, to
accept that imperfection is part of our human condition, and more often that
not, to witness the triumph of the human spirit."

>

> His final advice? "Go with the person, not just the resume. If you have a
choice, let the caring person have a learning curve, and trust that in the
end, keeping alive a tradition grounded in values is what's best for
Fairfield."

> ## Jean Santopatre, University photojournalist

>

> A warm welcome to the newest member of the public relations team, Jean
Santopatre, the University's new photojournalist.

>

> ![Jean](Images/Jean.JPG)  
> _Photo by Linda Gustavson_  
> _Jean Santopatre_  
> ---  
>  
> **_When did you start taking photographs?_**

>

> I studied photography, journalism, and film in high school and at Syracuse
University, where I received a B.S. in photojournalism with a minor in
geology. My junior year abroad, I studied photography with Prof. "TR" Richards
in London. By then I was hooked on documentary and people photography.

>

> While studying in London, and also at the University of Oslo, Norway, I
produced a brochure about the Geological Museum in London, and studied the
geology of Oslo and illustrated geologic formations in photos.

>

> **_What has been your career path?_**

>

> In April 1979, I landed a staff photo position at Brooks Community
Newspapers. I became chief photographer for the _Darien News-Review,_ leaving
in 1985 to pursue a freelance career with Gannett Westchester Newspapers, the
_Danbury News-Times,_ the _Hartford Courant,_ and _The New York Times._

>

> In 1986, I embarked on a 5-week photo documentary/bicycle tour called Bike
For Peace '86. I cycled through the Carpathinian Mountains from Presov to
Prague in Czechoslovakia. From there, we flew to Montreal and biked to the
United Nations in New York City. I received a Czechoslovakian Peace award for
my photographs.

>

> My next photojournalism jobs were with _The Norwalk Hour,_ and then the
_Bridgeport Post,_ which became _The Connecticut Post,_ where I remained for
nearly 14 years as a photographer and photo editor before becoming the
photojournalist for Fairfield University.

>

> **_What have been your favorite assignments?_**

>

> Besides the Bike For Peace '86 documentary, my favorite photo assignments
were with the _Post_ covering the HMS Rose. Another fabulous experience I had
was as an intern at Bergens Tidende in Bergen, Norway, when I was helicoptered
to an oil rig in the North Sea for 48 hours.

>

> _**Have you photographed anyone famous?**_

>

> I have had the opportunity to photograph many famous people, including
former presidents Clinton, Reagan, and Bush, and celebrities such as Paul
Newman, Paul McCartney (at his home in London!), and King Olav in Norway.

>

> **_Whose work do you admire?_**

>

> I love the work of Henri Cartier Bresson, but the Ansel Adams photo I most
admire is "Moonrise over Hernandez, New Mexico." I try to mix the qualities of
Bresson, Adams, and W. Eugene Smith in my own photography. Documentary
photography is my favorite venue, but I enjoy meeting people and photographing
daily life and portraits.

>

> **_What do you look forward to at Fairfield?_**

>

> I look forward to documenting the history of the University on a daily
basis. I have met wonderful people at the University and look forward to
meeting many more.

>

> **_When you're not taking photographs, how do you like to spend your
time?_**

>

> My husband Michael and I, and our son, Dylan, live in Black Rock. We love
being by the sea. Michael is a tug boat deckhand for Reinauer and is a ships'
rigger. We enjoy sailing on the HMS Rose, bicycling, travelling, and reading.

> ## Fairfield University and First Selectman announce new initiatives to
address beach concerns

>

> _By Douglas J. Whiting, Associate Vice President for Public Relations_

>

> Fairfield University and the Town of Fairfield have announced a series of
new initiatives aimed at addressing ongoing concerns about the behavior of
some Fairfield University students at Fairfield Beach.

>

> In a joint announcement on January 11, Fairfield University President Rev.
Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J. and First Selectman John Metsopoulos said that
significant progress has been made in curbing inappropriate student behavior
at the beach, but problems remain and events like the September 30 luau need
to be curtailed.

>

> Fr. Kelley and Metsopoulos said that Fairfield Beach attracts a wide variety
of young people, including patrons to local establishments, high school
students, and students from other area colleges and universities, making the
total eradication of illegal and inappropriate behavior difficult and not the
sole responsibility of the University. Nonetheless, they acknowledged that the
since a proportionately large segment of the Fairfield Beach population
comprises Fairfield University students, new policies and procedures needed to
be established. These include:

>

>   * Fairfield University will increase fines for off-campus violations of
its code of conduct.

>   * Fairfield University will deny students who have multiple violations of
its code of conduct the opportunity to live at Fairfield Beach.

>   * Fairfield University will, upon written authorization of a student,
release personal disciplinary histories to prospective landlords.

>   * The Town, with the support of the University, will seek landlord
cooperation in prohibiting large gatherings at Lantern Point homes or conduct
that would constitute a nuisance.

>

> Fr. Kelley said that the changes in University sanctions for violations of
its code of conduct would take effect beginning January 17.

>

> Details of the new sanctions are as follows:

>

>   * Any student who is found responsible for violating the University's code
of conduct while off campus within the Town of Fairfield will be subject to
the following minimum sanctions: $200 fine and probation with the office of
the Dean of Students for a first offense; $400 fine and University
disciplinary probation for a second offense; suspension from the University
for a third offense.

>   * Students who in the past were found guilty of multiple offenses and
received a "Loss of Campus Residency" sanction will now receive a sanction
that excludes them from participating in the University lottery system for
independent living arrangements. Independent living arrangements are defined
as townhouses, village apartments, and off-campus housing.

>

> Fr. Kelley noted that all Fairfield University undergraduates were notified
of the changes in sanctions by letter to their homes from Vice President for
Student Services William P. Schimpf during the semester break.

>

> Fr. Kelley and the First Selectman said that events like last September's
student-run luau must be curtailed and any behavior that is illegal or
inappropriate will not be tolerated. They said, however, that the progress
already made as a result of substantial initiatives on the part of the
University, announced nearly two years ago, has not been appropriately
recognized.

>

> Those initiatives included the construction of a $16 million apartment
village residence hall on campus, thereby removing some 200 students from
living at the beach; the hiring of a coordinator for off-campus students;
amending its code of conduct to emphasize that students are required to adhere
to the University's Community Standards regardless of whether they are living
on or off campus; committing tens of thousands of new dollars to on-campus
student programming; moving the University's annual Alumni Homecoming to a
date later in the fall with additional on-campus day and evening programs; and
increasing its educational efforts to bring to University students a greater
awareness of the dangers of alcohol misuse.

>

> Those efforts contributed to a 25 percent reduction in the number of
Fairfield University students arrested for off-campus violations during the
fall 2000 semester, a 30 percent reduction in the number of Fairfield
University students with off-campus addresses, and more than 300 students
entering the University's judicial system for activities at Fairfield Beach
since the fall of 1999.

>

> Fr. Kelley thanked the First Selectman for his leadership role in bringing
University and Town officials together in the quest for reasonable and
workable solutions to such difficult issues. "I believe that these steps,
taken together with those initiatives already underway, underscore the
University's commitment to working with the First Selectman and the Town of
Fairfield in addressing areas of mutual concern," Fr. Kelley said. "I want to
thank John and his team for their leadership and their cooperative spirit in
moving this process forward."

was taken). Sections of the library's new addition will open for public use
this month. Among the areas scheduled to open today and through the end of
February are new offices for the library's staff, the main entrance, foyer,
reading room, a cafe, the circulation desk, main staircases, a 24-hour
computer lab, and group study rooms.

addition have been completed. The library is expected to be finished in late
May or early June.

> ## Dr. Cornel West reflects on the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.

>

> As part of the University's Martin Luther King, Jr. Human Relations
Celebration last month, Dr. Cornel West encouraged audiences that looking at
one's self is the first step toward social change.

>

> ![DrCornelWest](Images/DrCornelWest.JPG)  
> _Photo by Jean Santopatre_  
> ---  
>  
> He asked the audience to consider what it means to be human and how to take
seriously democratic ideas and practices. "Brother Martin was a symbol of hope
... His concept of hope is rooted in all humans who wrestle with those two
questions," he said.

>

> He listed issues of male supremacy, American supremacy, homophobia, and
prejudices against disabled people, Islamic and Arab peoples, and women, as
among those social ills that "must die if the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. should live."

>

> Referring to the works of Malcolm X, Emerson, Whitman, Socrates, O'Neill,
and others, he reflected on what it means to take seriously the legacy of Dr.
King.

>

> "Martin Luther King, Jr. is part of a tradition, a wave in an ocean," Dr.
West told the packed house, "and that tradition is vibrant and alive."

>

> Prior to his address, University President Rev. Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J.
presented Dr. West with the LaFarge Award, named after Rev. John LaFarge,
S.J., a Jesuit priest who worked for racial justice. Also honored were
Elizabeth Hohl, adjunct professor of history; Felipe Reinoso, principal and
co-founder of The Bridge Academy High School in Bridgeport; Edward Brennan,
principal of Fairfield's Tomlinson Middle School; and Kathy Niznansky, chair
of Tomlinson's Diversity Committee.

>

> The [**School of Continuing Education**](../../sce/index.htm) kicks off a
new lecture series this month which focuses on the wisdom of St. Ignatius
Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits. The series includes discussion on Jesuit
history, spirituality, and traditions.

>

> Loyola, a man of prayer, a leader, a writer, and profound thinker, founded
The Society of Jesus in 1540. Thousands of Jesuit schools, colleges,
universities, retreat houses, spiritual centers, parishes, and approximately
25,000 Jesuits today continue to carry on his theological spirit.

>

> The series is as follows:

>

> ## Tibetan visitors share their "Mystical Arts" at Fairfield

>

> _By Jill Kasiewicz, Editor_

>

> Fairfield was treated to a glimpse of Tibetan culture and traditions last
month, as the University hosted a group of Lamas (monks) from the Drepung
Loseling Monastery.

>

> With the intent to promote peace and healing by sharing cultural traditions
and rituals of Tibet, the group's week-long visit included a performance of
sacred music and dance and the construction of a vibrant sand mandala - one
grain at a time - at the Walsh Art Gallery.

>

> The five-day construction was part of "The Mystical Arts of Tibet: Mandala,
Photography, and Dance," currently on exhibit at the Gallery. Photographs of
the landscape and culture of Tibet is on display through February 26. Included
in the collection are photos by Dr. Katherine Schwab, director of the art
history program, taken during a trip to India last summer which included stops
in Katmandu and the Himalayas. Dr. Ronald Davidson, associate professor of
religious studies, wrote the captions to her photos. Dr. Davidson spent last
summer in Nepal, conducting research at a Tibetan Buddhist refugee settlement.

>

> Dr. Diana Mille, director of the Walsh Art Gallery, was instrumental in
bringing the Lamas to Fairfield. She envisioned their visit as relevant to
students taking courses in a variety of departments. "We wanted to get as many
disciplines as possible involved, since the exhibit offers so much to
everyone, regardless of their course of study," she said. The departments of
visual and performing arts, religion, Asian studies, international studies,
and modern languages, are among those that have incorporated the program and
exhibit into their courses.

>

> "People flooded the Gallery all week to watch the mandala creation," said
Dr. Schwab. "It was wonderful to watch the expressions on the students' faces.
They were fascinated!"

>

> In keeping with tradition, the mandala was destroyed at the Mill River
following its completion. This is done to symbolize the "impermanence of the
world around us," said Dakpa Kalden, who accompanies the group throughout
their tour. Carried by the river waters, the sands are believed to spread
healing energies throughout the world.

>

> How do the artists work on the piece for up to six hours at a time? "While
they are working," Kalden explained, "they maintain a good sense of meditative
mindfulness."

Walsh Gallery last month. Using brightly colored sand and metal funnels, these
Tibetan Monks bent over chalk-drawn lines for five days to transform their
geometric design into a mandala. The funnels create a unique sound,
reminiscent of a springtime chorus of peepers and crickets._

>

> ## Dr. Mark Ligas: Got bad service? Tell him about it

>

> _By Jill Kasiewicz, Editor_

>

> Have you ever had a negative experience with a service provider - a bank
teller, hair stylist, hotel clerk, restaurant manager, physician - who did not
complete the job as you expected? We've all been there at least once (but
probably more), and Dr. Mark Ligas, assistant professor of marketing, wants to
hear about it.

>

> ![DrmarkLigas](Images/DrmarkLigas.JPG)  
> _Photo by Jean Santopatre_  
> _Dr. Mark Ligas_  
> ---  
>  
> As part of his recently-completed dissertation, Dr. Ligas collected such
stories from more than 40 individuals. His objective was to identify examples
of common verbal and non-verbal reactions so service personnel can identify
dissatisfaction early on and possibly alter the situation to appease the
customer and maintain a future relationship. "Managers need to be aware of
signals that customers give off. Not everyone vocalizes dissatisfaction. Non-
verbal reactions may include a frown, a twitch, or just plain walking out.
It's not only what people say."

>

> Many respondents told Dr. Ligas that they were amazed when they were the
recipients of bad service. "Most people I spoke with had previously felt very
loyal to their providers, and therefore felt personally betrayed when the
service was different from what they had come to expect," he says. Whether a
customer for years or just a few months, many thought they had a personal
friendship with their service provider. "People said things like, 'I was a
regular customer and a good tipper, so how could this have happened to me?'"

>

> Some of the stories he heard were truly shocking. There was a dentist who
pulled the wrong tooth; a seamstress who hemmed the skirts too short - in the
front.

>

> Yet it's the seemingly established relationship with the provider that makes
it difficult for many clients to just walk away. Dr. Ligas found that most
fell into one of four categories: loyalist, placekeeper, pessimist, and
terminator.

>

> At polar opposites are the loyalists and terminators. "The loyalist's intent
is to stay with the service provider for the long term," says Dr. Ligas,
"whereas the terminator says 'good-bye forever' by walking out on the
relationship."

>

> In the middle are the placekeepers and pessimists. The placekeeper remains
with the provider but begins to "shop around" for another provider. The
pessimist says "good-bye for now," and may return after discovering there are
no better providers "out there."

>

> "When people are dissatisfied, it really sticks with them," says Dr. Ligas.
"I didn't expect to find so many people who were willing to say, 'So long with
you, you screwed up and now I'm gone,' and give up on a relationship they had
for so long."

>

> One unexpected result from his study was the gratitude he received from the
respondents. "Many of them thanked me for allowing them to voice their
negative experiences, and for just listening to them. I guess it's always good
to get something like that off your chest," he says.

>

> He also interviewed a group of service providers (different from those who
worked with the customers he interviewed) who gave him an interesting
perspective on some of the experiences he had heard. "In hearing their
'sides,' I wondered, whose fault was it really, and learned where customers
ultimately place blame."

>

> Dr. Ligas hopes to incorporate elements of this study into a future
undergraduate course on services, concentrating on developing customer
relationships. "Understanding why customers are dissatisfied is very important
to businesses," he says. "Providers have to realize that customers almost
always have the option to go elsewhere for that same service."

> ## Fairfield announces first Arthur Andersen Fellows

>

> _By Nancy Habetz, Director of Media Relations_

>

> Dr. Orin Grossman, academic vice president, has named the first two Arthur
Andersen Fellows for the Charles F. Dolan School of Business: Dr. Bruce
Bradford, associate professor of accounting, and Dr. Carl Scheraga, associate
professor of information systems and operations management.

>

> In selecting the two professors for the honor, Dr. Grossman said he looked
for outstanding teachers and scholars who were willing to try new materials
and teaching techniques in the classroom.

>

> The award was established by the late Dean of the School of Business, Dr.
Walter Ryba, and Dr. Grossman, and is made possible through generous funding
from the Arthur Andersen Accounting Firm.

>

> Each professor will receive a monetary award presented annually for a three-
year period, and a plaque of distinction. Joseph Berardino '72, chief
executive officer of Arthur Andersen and a University trustee (see box below),
said, "The Arthur Andersen Fellows program is intended to acknowledge
outstanding scholarship and teaching on the part of faculty. We have been very
pleased with the Fairfield University graduates who work for Arthur Andersen
and want to recognize and support the continued commitment we see at the Dolan
School of Business to innovation and technical competency, so necessary in
today's business environment."

>

> **Dr. Bruce Bradford**

>

> ![AAfellowbradford](Images/AAfellowbradford.JPG)

>

> Dr. Bradford holds a doctorate in accounting from the University of Memphis
and a doctorate in plant pathology from Virginia Tech. His unique science
background, coupled with his accounting training, has earned him an
outstanding reputation for producing respected research publications and
conference presentations. As Director of Research for the Dolan School of
Business, he has been a mentor to other faculty in their research and
publication activities.

>

> A talented teacher as well, Dr. Bradford's expertise in cost accounting and
in the dramatic changes in the field, resulting from technology and the
development of information systems, has enriched all of his classes. He has
developed new and exciting course work in these areas and is instrumental in
the continuous updating of all accounting courses.

_Description:_ In 1859 Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote of the new science and art
of photography: "Every conceivable object of Nature and Art will soon scale
off its surface for us. Men will hunt all curious, beautiful, grand objects,
as they hunt the cattle in South America, for their skins and leave the
carcasses as of little worth." We now live in the world that Holmes could then
only glimpse. In this course we will study the relationship between skin and
carcass, surface and reality through the history of oil painting, light,
photography, films, television, public relations and cosmetics. We will pay
special attention to issues of representation, presentations, spectatorship
and celebrity.  
  
_Requirements:_  
1) Attendance, diligent reading, and active participation in all class
discussions.  
2) Three short essays--approximately 6-8 pages--over the course of the
semester.  
  
， I'm always open to suggestions on assignments. A video, poem, performance,
web page, etc. in place of one of the written assignments is possible and
could be very exciting. Just talk to me first.  
  
， Papers can be re-written for a new grade, but the re-write must be handed in
within two weeks of first receiving back the corrected paper.

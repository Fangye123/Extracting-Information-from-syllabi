![Sterling Hall of Medicine](../images/sterling3.jpg) Yale School of Medicine
is one of the 11 sites of the Minority Medical Education Program (MMEP), a
national program funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. All program
sites share the common goal of preparing minority students to become more
successful applicants to medical school. The specific program structure and
content varies from site to site. Presented here is an overview of the Yale
MMEP program.

**Program Outline**  
The Yale Minority Medical Education Program (MMEP) is an intensive six-week
intensive summer program for highly motivated college students who are
considering a career in medicine. The Yale program has five primary
components:

  * **science modules** expose students to a problem-focused learning model of science education that is similar to that used in many medical schools;  
  

  * **writing and communication class** offers students workshops and seminars that will improve reading and writing skills, including development of a personal statement for medical school application;  
  

  * **clinical exposure** provides students with a variety of clinical experiences to develop an understanding of the doctor-patient relationship;  
  

  * **career planning and guidance** in seminars and one-on-one sessions offers students practical and detailed advice and guidance about the medical school application process, including financial aid and financing a medical school education;  
  

  * **biomedicine in the 21st century** is discussed in a lecture series given by Yale faculty to give students an understanding of the breadth of career opportunities and the many challenges facing biomedical science in the years ahead.

![](../images/jump_arrow.gif)  
  

**Yale MMEP Academic Societies**  
![](../images/transparent.gif) Yale MMEP students are divided into three
groups based on years in college and prior exposure to science courses. The
groups are called Societies which have names based on important historical
figures in medicine. The curricular content designed for the Societies
overlaps to some extent but has differing approaches in terms of specific
goals and objectives. Students are assigned to Societies based on information
in their MMEP applications.  
  

> **Elizabeth Blackwell Society**  
>  [![Elizabeth Blackwell \(1849-1909\) - First Woman
Physician](../images/blackwellEliz.jpg)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/blackwell/)For
freshman and sophomore students who are in the early stages of their
undergraduate curriculum and who have had limited exposure to college-level
chemistry courses.  
>  
>  
>  
>  **Daniel Hale Williams Society**  
>  [![Daniel Hale Williams \(1856-1931\) - African American surgeon who
performed the first open heart
surgery](../images/williamsDH.jpg)](http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emcbrown/display/williams.html)
For sophomore and junior students who have or are about to complete their pre-
med course requirements but are not yet at the stage of taking the MCAT or
applying to medical school. This Society, the largest, includes the
_**Visalius** , **Osler** , **Cushing**_ and _**Flexner**_ Societies.  
>  
>  
>  **Aesculapius Society**  
>  ![Painting of A Sick Child Brought Into The Temple of Aesculapius by John
William Waterhouse \(1849-1917\)](../images/aesculapius.jpg) For rising senior
and/or post-baccalaureate students who wish to concentrate their efforts on
preparing for the MCAT and the Fall medical school application process.
Students are provided with MCAT preparation activities, including intensive
work on the application process and development of a personal statement. The
MCAT track students also participate in the all science and writing courses.
However, small group teaching sessions are targeted to MCAT preparation.

**Academic program overview**  
![Yale MMEP Student](../images/mmepstudwrite2.jpg) Yale MMEP exposes students
to an academic and learning environment very similar to what they would
encounter as a first-year medical student at Yale School of Medicine. It is an
intensive program of study which encompasses diverse topics in biomedical
science. In both classroom and seminar settings, teachers cover topics in
basic and clinical sciences as well as highly individualized instruction in
writing and communication skills.  
  
Students develop a foundation of knowledge and skills needed to become
successful medical school applicants and future physicians. The emphasis of
the Yale MMEP program is not on MCAT preparation, although MCAT review and
practice MCAT test-taking are offered.  
  
![](../images/jump_arrow.gif)  
  
  
**Science course modules**  
![Iona Black, Ph.D. - MMEP Chemistry Instructor and Yale Faculty
Member](../images/iona.jpg) Three two-week science modules are taught by Yale
College science faculty members. The course materials cover concepts in
physical and organic chemistry, fundamentals of genetics, cell biology,
molecular biology, and biotechnology. Classroom lectures are complemented by
small group seminars, problem-solving sections, and discussions groups for
presentation and review of scientific journal articles. Students gain an
appreciation of the individual skills medical students must acquire to master
the rigors of a medical school curriculum.  

**Writing and communications course**  
![Yale MMEP student](../images/studentwriting.jpg) All students participate in
this course which aims to develop students" abilities to communicate
effectively in oral or written format. The course is taught in small group
sections by Yale University Humanities graduate students/writers. As part of
this course, students have the opportunity to begin work on personal
statements for their medical school application. A diverse range of scientific
topics from both science, social science, and humanities literature are
gathered in a syllabus of reading materials provided to each student at the
beginning of the course.

![](../images/jump_arrow.gif)  
  
  
**Career planning and development**  
![Naudia Lauder YSM '04 - MMEP Coordinator 2001](../images/naudia.jpg)
Thorough a variety of lectures, seminars and informal activities, social
gatherings, faculty host dinners, and individual meetings with program
directors, students have numerous opportunities to discuss their career
interests with Yale students, faculty, and administrators. These discussions
occur both in groups and in one-on-one sessions. The program strives to
enhance every student's opportunity for success and, at the same time, to
demonstrate the rewards of dedication, hard work, and perseverance.  
  
![](../images/transparent.gif)The **Biomedical Lecture Series** exposes
students to diverse areas of biomedical science and investigation as they
impact medicine and health care. Topics included areas in basic science and
clinical investigation. The following topics were presented:

**Social environment**  
![MMEP Students on Yale Medical School Campus](../images/mmepstudwalk.jpg)
Yale MMEP is more than just six weeks of hard work to prepare for medical
school. Students also have an opportunity to work together, share experiences
and aspirations - and to simply enjoy each other's friendship and support.
Through organized and informal social activities, MMEP students develop a new
network of relationships and experiences that are remembered and valued for
years.  
  
![](../images/transparent.gif)Yale MMEP is especially proud of the diverse
group of students who elect to enroll in the program each year. Students from
many cultural and ethnic/racial backgrounds create a unique environment of
cross-cultural exchange, mutual respect, and increased self-awareness.  
  
[![Yale University main
campus](../images/yaleuniv.jpg)](http://www.yale.edu)Summer is an exciting
time at Yale. All of the major University facilities function throughout the
year. The main campus of [Yale College](http://www.yale.edu) and [Yale School

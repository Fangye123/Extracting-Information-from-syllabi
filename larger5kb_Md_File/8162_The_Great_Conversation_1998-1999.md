---|---  
This is a limited enrollment two-course sequence introducing students to
seminal thinkers in the Western tradition. Through reading and small group
discussion students will explore the thinking of selected authors from Plato
to Aquinas and the assumptions underlying the Western world-view. Polarities
such as individual freedom/social responsibility, law/justice and
pragmatism/idealism exemplify core notions in premodern Western thought that
will be treated in the course. The course emphasizes writing; students will
write substantial essays each semester; in addition they will be encouraged to
extend the conversation beyond the classroom by posting weekly responses to
their reading on a course world wide web page. They will also use the page to
answer questions posed by faculty and by other students.  
  
Core faculty include: Harry Rutledge, Professor Emeritus of Classics,
President, Vergilian Society of America (1976-8), President, American
Classical League (1990-4) and UTK Macebearer (1992-3); Alvin Burstein,
Professor, Psychology, Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the
American Psychological Society, and the Society for Values in Higher Education
and a practicing psychoanalyst; and Anthony Gilles, with degrees in history
and law, a member of the United States Supreme Court bar, author of 11 books
on history and a Shakespearean actor. They will be joined by other faculty in
English, History, Zoology, Classics, and Philosophy.  
  
Students are not required to register for both semesters; a grade of C or
better in 210 will be required of students who wish to register for the second
term. Students who achieve a grade of B or better in this 9-credit sequence
will be able to petition for it to satisfy the 12-credit English
composition-U.S. history lower division requirement.  
  
Enrollment is limited to 25. Consent of the instructor is required. For more

**REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**  
This is a course intended to involve students in the exploration and exchange
of ideas. The intent is for students to become engaged in the  "Great
Conversation," a colloquy of many voices over the ages dealing with ideas
central to Western civilization. We expect students to participate in that
conversation during class discussions; in addition, the conversation will be
conducted in exchanges on an electronic bulletin board and by means of papers
written for and discussed in class.  
  
Each week you will be expected to post a 100-word comment on the work under
discussion and to respond to queries from your classmates and from the
faculty. In addition, you will be expected to write a 2,000-word paper on a
topic (see suggested topics) approved by the faculty. You should have selected
your topic by October 20. During the last week in October we will schedule a
brief, ungraded student forum in which each student will field questions on
his or her topic. At the end of the term we will schedule a second, graded
student forum in which each student will field questions on his or her topic.
Fifty percent of your grade will be based on your paper. Twenty-five percent
of your grade will be based on your final forum performance. Twenty-five
percent of your grade will be based on participation in discussion in class
and on the virtual bulletin board.

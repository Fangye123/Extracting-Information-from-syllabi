**ABOUT THE COURSE**

This course is a graduate-level seminar in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
It will lead you on an exploration of the current HCI literature. It is not a
lecture course! The class meetings will be conducted as research group
meetings, during which class members will present, discuss, and analyze papers
from the literature.  


#### Prerequisite

This course has a strict prerequisite of 91.527 Human-Computer Interaction.
You may not take this course without the prerequisite or the instructor's
permission.  


#### Required textbook

_CSCW 2000:   Proceedings of the ACM 2000 Conference on Computer Supported
Cooperative Work_, published by the Association for Computing Machinery, 2000.
(Available in the North Campus Bookstore.)  


#### Course goals

The goals of the course are for you to:

  * become a more critical reader of the HCI literature 
  * learn, in depth, what is currently understood about some important HCI topics 

In this course, you will

  * read approximately 24 papers from the HCI literature 
  * make frequent presentations to the class 
  * discuss the papers during class 
  * participate in on-line discussions about the papers 
  * give and receive feedback about presentations 
  

#### Course requirements

The requirements for the course are as follows:

  * attend and participate during all class meetings 
  * read the assigned papers from the CSCW 2000 Proceedings 
  * prepare and deliver formal presentations to the class 
  * participate in the on-line discussions of the papers 

For more detail, see the Grading policy section, below.  


#### Online discussion forum

We will be using an online discussion forum called Nicenet for discussions of
the papers.  I will give you the "key" for joining the Nicenet "class" for our
Seminar.  To learn more about Nicenet and to register as a user, go to:
<http://www.nicenet.org/>  


#### Connections MOO

We will hold two of our classes in a MOO called Connections.  I will arrange
for you to have a "character" in the MOO.  In the meantime, please (1) go to
the Connections homepage to read about the MOO and about MUD client software;
(2) download and install a MUD client onto your machine; and (3) log into
Connections as a guest to learn your way around. My "room" in the MOO is
called the CHImera Seminar.  Connections homepage:

#### GRADING POLICY

#### Presentation points

For each presentation, you can earn up to 10 points, as follows:

>  5 points for content  
>  5 points for organization and clarity of the presentation, and for the use
of well-designed presentation aids

  

#### Participation points

For each class meeting after the first, you can earn up to 5 points, as
follows:

> Attendance

>

>>  2 points for attending the entire class  
>  1 point for attending class but missing more than 15 minutes of it  
>  0 points if you don't attend

>

> Class participation

>

>>  2 points for making substantive contributions during discussion  
>  1 point for minor contributions  
>  0 points if you don't participate

>

> Online discussion conference participation

>

>>  1 point for substantive contributions  
>  0 points for non-participation or contributions without substance

Note:  You can earn both presentation points and participation points during
the same class meeting.

  

#### Semester grade

Your presentation points and participation points will be added together. The
percentage you earned of all the possible points you could have earned will be
computed.  The following table shows the percentage necessary to earn the
corresponding letter grade for the semester.

> Grade -- Percentage  
> A -- 92%  
> AB -- 84%  
> B -- 76%  
> BC -- 68%  
> C -- 60%  
> F -- below 60%  
>  

**ORIGINAL WORK POLICY**  
In keeping with University policy, all work that you submit and present must
be your own original work. While I encourage you to discuss your work with
each other, the work you submit or present must be yours alone. If you quote
someone else, you must give attribution. As Prof. Sarah Kuhn says, "Using
works of others, or drawing extensively on their ideas, without clearly
stating that they are not your work (by using quotation marks, and references
to the cited work) is plagiarism, a very serious academic offense" [Sarah
Kuhn, Syllabus for 65.790].  


#### RESOURCES (this list will grow during the semester)

The HCI Bibliography --  <http://hcibib.org>  
The ACM Digital Library --  available through the Library's website
(<http://library.uml.edu>) if you connect from a machine in the UML domain
(including connecting through a PPP account \-- there's information about how
to apply for one on the Library's website).

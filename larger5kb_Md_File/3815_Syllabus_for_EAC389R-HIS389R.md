This course focuses on the dramatic changes that China underwent between the
eighth and the fourteenth centuries. We will examine this transformation from
several historical perspectives: political and economic history, social
history, intellectual history, and cultural history in order to better
understand China's shift from aristocratic to literati society.

**Grading policies:**  
Please note the following policies:  

  1. Letter grades are assigned according to the following scale: A=93-100, A-=90-92, B+=87-89, B=83-86, B-=80-82, C+=77-79, C=73-76, C-=70-72, D+=67-69, D=63-66, D-=60-62, E=less than 60. Please note that work never turned in counts as a zero (0).  

  2. Late papers lose one grade step for each day late (thus a B+ that is two days late receives a B-).  

  3. I do not give make-up exams unless you have an acceptable and documented excuse (for example, a medical excuse signed by a physician).  

  4. I will not consider requests for incompletes without a clearly documented and acceptable reason.  

  5. Plagiarism is using or purchasing the words or ideas of another and passing them off as one's own work. If a student quotes someone in a formal paper, that student must use quotation marks and give a citation. Paraphrased or borrowed ideas are to be identified by proper citations. Plagiarism will result, at the minimum, in a zero (0) for the assignment.

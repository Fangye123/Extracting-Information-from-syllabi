### **Introduction to Comparative Politics**

Introduction to Comparative Politics is a beginning level course intended to
familiarize students with the study of politics in other societies. This class
will focus on four case study countries -- Chile, China, Great Britain, and
South Africa. In analyzing the politics of these four countries, the course
will expose students to the diversity of the modern world and teach students
methods for studying other countries, means to approach other nations both
sympathetically and critically. Principle questions explored during the
semester will include: How can political change be accomplished given the
weight of history and political culture? How is political power maintained?
What is the relationship between the political system and the economy? How do
societies influence their political system, and specifically how do diverse
social groups relate to the state?

There are three basic goals for this course: 1. To familiarize students with
the politics, history, culture, and economics of South Africa, Great Britain,
China, and Chile; 2. to teach students how to analyze politics in various
countries, i.e., to teach students the practice of comparative politics; and
3. to help students learn to think critically.

Students will be graded based upon their knowledge of the four countries
covered, on their ability to apply the skills of comparative politics to the
four countries, and on their use of critical thinking, as demonstrated in
performance on two exams and two papers and in participation in classroom
discussions. The grades will be distributed as follows:

20% Mid-Term Exam  
20% First Essay  
20% Second Essay  
30% Final Exam  
10% Class Discussions  
  
The midterm exam will take place during class time on March 8 and will consist
of short answers and one essay question. The final exam will consist of short
answers and two essay questions. The essays questions for each exam will be
selected from a list of possible questions, which will be provided to students
at least a week before each exam in order to assist students in their
preparations. Students will not be allowed to use notes or books during the
exams.

Students are required to write two short papers during the semester. The
first, based on the reading of the book Wild Swans by Jung Chang will be due
in class on February 13. The second, based on the reading of Kaffir Boy, is
due in class on April 24. Papers received after the beginning of class will be
counted as late. Papers will lose one grade for each day that they are late.
Details on the requirements for the paper will be handed out early in the
semester.

Active classroom participation is essential to the learning process in this
course. The goal of this course is not for students to memorize a list of
facts but rather for students to learn principles of political analysis and
critical thinking. Class discussions provide students an opportunity to apply
the principles learned in this course. Attendance is therefore required, and
10% of the grade will be based on attendance in class and informed
participation in discussions. The reading load for this course is heavy. To
get the most out of classroom discussions (and to be well prepared for exams),
it is important that students keep up with the reading. If for any reason you
need to miss a large number of classes, please contact the dean of students so
that we can find a means for you to make up the missed work.

I encourage all students to come talk with me if you have questions at any
time during the semester or if you wish to discuss ideas covered in the course
-- or if you want to discuss anything else, for that matter. My regularly
scheduled office hours are Thursday 11:30-1:00 in 405 Rockefeller. Other
meetings can be arranged by appointment. Or feel free to drop by my office in
Rockefeller.

Academic accommodations are available for students with documented
disabilities. Please schedule an appointment with me early in the semester to
discuss any accommodation that may be needed for the course. All
accommodations must be approved through the Office of Disability and Support
Services (ext. 7584) as indicated in their accommodation letter.

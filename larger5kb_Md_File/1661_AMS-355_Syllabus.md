> In 1587, Sir Walter Raleigh sent a colony of 117 English men, women and
children to settle the windswept dunes of Roanoke Island, along the Outer
Banks of modern-day North Carolina. Within three years, the colonists had
vanished and no trace of them was ever found. The only piece of evidence was a
word carved on an old door post, "Croatoan," the name of a friendly
neighboring Indian tribe. Yet over the course of the next two hundred and
fifty years, a seemingly unabated flood of immigrants from England, Europe and
Africa would help transform the cultural landscape of North America.

>

> This interdisciplinary course explores various cultural currents in American
society from the first moments of European contact to the conflagration of the
Civil War. Throughout the course, we will consider a central question: how did
a disparate and contentious conglomeration of Native Americans, British and
European colonists, Southwestern Chicanos, indentured servants and African
slaves all come to see themselves as distinctly "American?" How did various
Americans articulate (and contest) abstract political concepts like
"citizenship," "republicanism," and "democracy" through religious practices,
street parades, architecture, songs, traveling fairs, novels, paintings,
museum displays, theater, and social reform? How did this fragile, shared
national identity collapse in 1861 with the onset of the Civil War? Class
format: This is primarily a lecture course, but I will always leave some time
available during each class for discussion.

>

> **Requirements:** Regular attendance, completion of all reading assignments,
two in-class exams, and a final take-home exam.

>

> **Grading:** First exam (in-class): 20%; Second exam (in-class): 30%; Final
take-home exam: 50 %. A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 60-69; F: 0-59.

>

> **Exam Format:** The in-class exams will be closed-book and will contain
five identification questions (choice of ten) and one essay question (choice
of two). The take-home final will be open-book, and will contain five ID s,
and two essays. The first question (choice of two) will draw from the lecture
material and reading assignments from the last third of the course while the
second (choice of two) will draw upon material from throughout the course.
Throughout the course, you will be expected to support your essay answers with
evidence from the assigned readings, lectures and other media like music or
slides shown in class. For this reason, regular class attendance is critical
in order to do well in the course. Improvement will be rewarded!!!!!

>

> **Make-up policy:** Failure to take a scheduled examination without making
prior arrangements will result in an automatic zero for that exam. I will
allow you to take a make-up exam only in the event of a medical or family
emergency, religious holiday, or if you have official, documented University
of Texas at Austin business outside of campus. In both cases, you must notify
me or the T.A. BEFORE the scheduled exam. All make-up exams must be taken
within one week of the scheduled exam. I strongly advise against make-up exams
for a couple reasons: 1) your retention of the material will be weaker at a
later date, and consequently, you may perform more poorly than you might in
class 2) the questions on the make-up exam are likely to be more difficult
than those on the scheduled test because I will ask the most obvious questions
on the in-class exam.

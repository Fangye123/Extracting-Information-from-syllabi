###  Course Description:

A comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of operating
systems illustrated by examples from contemporary systems. This course
emphasizes the design tradeoffs involved in operating system design. Topics
include: process management, concurrency, deadlock, CPU scheduling, memory
management, disk management, file systems, security, distributed operating
systems, real-time operating systems, and multiprocessor operating systems.

###  Prerequisites for undergraduates:

  * CSCI 326 (Language and Structure of Computers) and CSCI 287 (Data Structures); or 
  * permission of the instructor. 

###  Prerequisites for graduate students:

  * CSCI 504 (Algorithms and Programming II) and CSCI 508 (Computer Organization and Design); or 
  * permission of the instructor. 

###  Doing Your Own Work:

  * **Programs and tests are meant to be your own work. You may only ask me for assistance on these items.** (You may ask Lab Workers for assistance with electromechanical problems at any time.) 
  * You **may not** share code. This means that you may not give or receive in any form -- oral, written, electronic, or otherwise -- from anyone -- another student, a written source such as a textbook or journal, the Net, or otherwise -- statements pertaining to the assignment, no matter how short or small, in Pascal, in C, in C++, in shell code, in any other programming language, or in pseudocode. Exceptions: You may use any code that I give you in class, out of class, or in the textbook used in this course. You may certainly ask me for exceptions for a small piece of code, provided that its source is clearly cited. 
  * All work by undergraduates **must** have the Honor Pledge ("I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.") written and signed on it. 

###  A realistic assessment of course requirements:

This course requires a substantial amount of work using computers. You are
encouraged to use the College's lab facilities, but you may use your own
computer and software resources if they are the same as we use in class. You
must learn to budget your time to allow for lab assignments, and you need to
develop a sense for when you are stuck and need help.

###  Required Text:

_Operating System Concepts (5th edition)_ , Abraham Silberschatz and Peter
Baer Galvin, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1998. ISBN 0-201-59113-8.

###  World Wide Web:

The World Wide Web page for this course
(<http://yakko.hood.edu/~sjsmith/csci064/>) has a link to this syllabus, and
will be updated with links to lecture notes and programming assignments as the
semester progresses.

###  Smoking:

I am very allergic to tobacco smoke (it gives me headaches and nausea). If I
see you on campus, and you are smoking, I will avoid you; don't take it
personally. Try not to smoke just before coming to class, and especially try
not to smoke just before coming to see me in my office.

###  Leave of absence:

I am taking a leave of absence from Hood during the 1999-2000 academic year.
As a result, you should not expect to be granted an incomplete grade for this
course.

###  Assignments:

  * _Reading Assignments_ :  
You will be expected to keep up with the readings by reading material before
the class at which it will be discussed. However, I don't expect that you will
understand everything that you have read. You do not serve yourself by being
exposed to these ideas for the first time in lecture. Keep notes in the
margins or in a notebook to remind you to ask them during lectures later.  
  

  * _Programming Assignments:_  
Roughly five programming assignments will require implementations in C or C++.
I recommend Borland C++, version 4.51 or greater, or Borland C++ Builder.
Please try not to use any strange features of Visual C++.

The most important change I am making to this course is the addition of a
unifying theme for programming assignments. Programming assignments will
involve the development of a virtual operating system on a virtual machine.
I'll give you more details during the first few weeks of class.

Programs will be due at the beginning of class. Details of program submissions
will be provided with each programming assignment, but will likely include
source files, test cases, and program listings.  
  

  * _Homework Assignments:_  
I will be giving, but not collecting, roughly ten homework assignments during
the semester. I will post answers to these homework assignments on the web
page for this course. I strongly recommend that you do these homework
assignments to prepare you for the tests.  
  

  * _Tests:_  
An in-class midterm exam and an in-class final exam are planned. They will be
similar in form and content to the types of questions on the homework
assignments. They will contain questions that concentrate on the most recent
half of the course, but will assume mastery of material in previous periods.
(Thus, **the final is comprehensive**.) These tests are intended to assess
your mastery of the key concepts and relationships investigated each half of
the course.  
  

###  No Communes:

Do not under any circumstances submit any assignment through communes (Hood's
campus mail system). Slip it under my door, put it in the box on my door, or
place it in my departmental mailbox (in Rosenstock room 330) by hand.

###  Final grades by email:

Students who provide me with an email address may receive their final grade by
email at the end of the semester (although I haven't been doing well with this
lately).

###  Attendance:

Attendance is important. I will certainly make reasonable accommodations for
students who have conflicts with scheduled classes. Remember that absence from
class does not excuse you from assigned work.

###  Grading Policy:

  * Assignments are due on the dates specified in each assignment. You will be penalized 10 points for each class meeting an assignment is delayed, including the class at which the assignment is due. (If I excuse the lateness on some assignment you turn in, but mistakenly assess a late penalty, it's nothing personal: I just forgot. Remind me of your excuse and I'll correct the penalty.) No assignments will be accepted after Wednesday, 12 May 1999, at 9:30 pm.   
  

  * It is entirely possible that no late programming projects will be accepted. If so, I will clearly state this on each programming project write-up.   
  

  * I reserve the right to require written documentation for any excused absences or lateness. Students with disabilities are responsible for notifying the professor. All assignments are in English, and academic standards are applied equally to all students without regard to written, oral, or semantic capabilities in English (see pages 228-229 in the 1998-1999 Catalog).   
  

  * I will award partial credit for work done even if the result is incorrect; you must show all your intermediate work and clearly label your answer. I will deduct points for answers that do not make any sense at all; you should always check your work, even work done using the computer.   
  

  * Undergraduates and graduates will be graded on the same scale throughout the course itself. However, undergraduates will be compared only with other undergraduates in the computation of final grades. 

###  Distribution of Weights in Grading:

(Numbers of graded assignments in each category may vary from this planned
amount.)  Programming Projects  |  (5)  |  40%  
---|---|---  
Exams  |  (2)  |  60%  
Class participation is important and will be considered in borderline cases.

###  Standard Disclaimer:

I reserve the right to change this syllabus.

###  Expectations:

  * Classes start on time and you should arrive on time. 
  * Ask questions in class and office hours. Please feel free to speak up if you did not understand something that was said. (If you don't understand something, I can only help you if I know that you don't understand it!) 
  * If you have a problem meeting some of the requirements for the class (for example, you are flying out of the country two days before the final exam), please let me know as soon as you become aware of the problem. The sooner I know, the more likely it is that I will be able to arrange a solution. 

###  Acknowledgments:

I have drawn heavily on the work of John Boon in preparing for this course.

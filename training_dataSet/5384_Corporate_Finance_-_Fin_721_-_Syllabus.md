## Overview

The goal of this undergraduate course in corporate finance is to give you a
basic understanding of financial decision-making within a corporation. Good
financial choices are essential to success in the marketplace and I want to
train you to make those decisions well. This will help you considerably
whether you are pursuing a career in finance or one in another business area
such as marketing, logistics, accounting or human relations where you will
need to understand what is driving basic financial choices in your company. In
addition, I have planned a set of group activities which will help you develop
your writing, case analysis and presentation skills.

Much of finance is highly theoretical and is currently challenging some of the
brightest minds in mathematics. While I admire these theoreticians, I have a
personal bias towards the practical. For this reason, we are going to focus on
many of the basic financial choices that companies make regarding their
capital expenditures, acquisitions and borrowing. At the same time we will
cover some important elements of the modern theory of finance which recently
brought Nobel prizes to Merton Miller, Bill Sharpe and Harry Markowitz. These
theoretical ideas are intuitive and will help you make better financial
decisions. Many of the principles of the course can be applied in your own
personal investments and in small, entrepreneurial businesses. However, the
course is not directed towards these applications.

This is an exciting time to be studying finance. Finance is still developing,
leaving plenty of opportunities for enterprising young managers to create
value in the real world with the right financial choices. Even though
corporate downsizing has been carrying much of the day, the job market in
finance this year has been strong. There are more people looking for well-
trained finance students in the marketplace than can be satisfied. If you
enjoy the material and would like to pursue a career in finance or are already
in the major, I recommend that you take the follow-up courses in Investment
Analysis, the Stock Market and International Finance.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for the class are [Bus-Fin 620](../../classes.htm#620)
(Business Finance) and Acct 211 (Introduction to Accounting).

### Teaching Philosophy

My goal is to see you learn. Grades are a carrot that encourage learning.
While I will not hesitate to give a poor grade when your performance indicates
that you have not learned the material, I want to see everyone do well. Thus,
I will do my best to help you understand the material and to do well on the
exams. I realize that you have a busy schedule and often face difficulty in
getting in enough time to study. This makes it all the more important to get
involved while you are here. We are going to have fun but expect to work hard.
This course covers a lot of material and has a lot of assigned work, so if you
don't keep up, you may be overwhelmed at exam time. I work people hard because
I want my students to get good jobs. Thus, if you are dedicated to learning
finance this is the course for you. And your hard work will be likely rewarded
with entry in a good graduate school or a solid job in finance, consulting or
accounting.

### Resources You will Need

  * [ **Brealey and Myers**](gopher://infx.infor.com:5000/0exec%3A-v%20a%20R583455-589475-/.text/Main%3A/.bin/aview), _Principles of Corporate Finance,_ McGraw-Hill, 1991.
  * **Headphones** to listen to multimedia programs (can use Walkman type headphones)
  * **Course packet at Cop-EZ in Ohio Union.** This packet contains copies of most class notes, answers to all homework problems and several old exams (used in a course that was a little more basic than BUS-FIN 721).
  * Access to a **financial calculator** such as an HP-12C which can compute present and future values of streams of cash flow. You will need this on the mid-term exam.

### Other Helpful Resources

  * _Study Guide to Accompany Principles of Corporate Finance_ by Charles A. D'Ambrosio and Stewart D. Hodges (McGraw-Hill). This is a very helpful aid that shows you how to solve problems and gives lots of practice problems in order that you may sharpen your skills.
  * _Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms,_ Barrons. This is a helpful book which allows you to find out what a specific term in finance means when you find yourself mystified when reading the text or the papers.
  * [Internet List of Educational Resources in Finance](../../educ.htm)
  * The Wall Street Journal.
We will discuss current financial news in most classes. Knowing what's going
on will help you in class and will help you in your work also.

  * Lewis, Scott, _Liars Poker_ , 1990. An entertaining discussion of the missteps of Salomon Brothers in the mortgage-backed securities market and in pushing bonds on unsuspecting clients.
  * Burrough, Bryan and John Helyar, _Barbarians at the Gate_ , 1990\. If you didn't catch it on HBO. This book gives you a good picture of how the big boys play on Wall Street. Discusses the leveraged buyout of RJR/Nabisco by Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts with lots of emphasis on the personalities and issues involved.

* * *

## Course Requirements

### Reading

The textbook is mandatory reading. You will be tested on material appearing in
assigned chapters in the textbook, even though all of this material is not
covered in class.

### Group Work

Much of your course grade will be based on group assignments as specified
below. By the second week of the class you are to join a group with a four to
six members and give me a list of your group members and a group name that
captures the essence of your group personality (e.g. Risky Business, Boozing
Bean Counters). If you are not able to join a group, you will be classified as
a free agent and should turn in a sheet of paper listing your name and your
status. I will then form groups with all of the remaining free agents.

### Case Assignments

Thirty percent of your course grade will be based on group case assignments.
Your group must turn in an analysis of questions for each case. In addition,
each group will present part of their analysis of a group assignment some time
in the semester. Case assignments are due at the start of class on the dates
scheduled for case discussion. The main purpose of the cases is for you to
learn how to apply theoretical financial concepts to real problems which firms
have faced. All case assignments must be typed and should be no more than
seven pages in length. Late papers will not be accepted under any conditions.

### Career Assignment

As mentioned above I want to see you get a rewarding job in finance. This
requires that you understand what jobs are out there and how to position
yourself. Thus, I want to help you start to prepare yourself now for your job
search. It will not be long before you are buying your job-market outfit and
finding yourself in a cold sweat for no obvious reason. Some of you will be
going to graduate school or already have a job staked out. But for those of
you who don't, I am here to help. First, I am going to talk about what careers
are available in finance. Second, I am going to assign a four to seven page
paper in which you describe your career aspirations. In this paper, I want you
to profile your skills and personal values and identify a job which matches
your profile. Then I want you to research and describe what this job involves.
To help you do this I will provide books, names of contacts in the business
community (if you are interested) and a computer software package on CD-ROM
called Career Paths in Finance. This package helps you figure our what types
of jobs you would enjoy, what these jobs are like, what they pay and how to
prepare yourself for them.

### Exams

There will be a mid-term exam and a final exam. While the final is not
cumulative, the material builds on itself as the course progresses. There will
be review sessions and review software provided before each exam.

### Homework Assignments

Problem sets will be assigned throughout the course. This homework will not be
collected, but it is essential that you work problems in order to understand
the material and perform well on the exams. For your own sake, please resist
the temptation to simply look at solutions to the problems without having
worked them yourself. Answers to these problems are given a course packet at
Cop-ez in the Ohio Union.

* * *

## Course Policies

### Grading (Total: 1000 points)

Case Assignments: 300  
Career Assignment: 100  
Midterm Exam: 300  
Final Exam: 300  

I consider class participation in borderline cases. I will curve the course
grades based on performance if the class average is below 70% (this is not
likely). Otherwise a straight scale will be used with the +/- system (e.g.
94-100 = A, 90-93 = A- etc.).

### Academic Misconduct

Cheating on exams and other academic misconduct is grounds for failing the
course and additional sanctions. In accordance with Faculty Rule 3335-5-487,
all instances of alleged academic misconduct will be reported to the Committee
on Academic Misconduct, which recommends appropriate sanctions to the Office
of Academic Affairs.

### Problems in Groups

I am a real believer in the group project format because it helps you learn
how to be part of a team. It is important then for you to work hard to make
sure that your group does good work. You are responsible for efforts to
motivate other group members to do their part. Don't do all the work yourself;
try to participate if you are shy; and try not to dominate the group if you
are not so shy. Most importantly, be a responsible group member. If members of
your group are shirking their duties bring that to my attention early. I will
try to work with the group to solve the problem. In the event that problems
persist and a group member is uncooperative or unduly difficult, the group may
divorce that member, provided that the problem was brought to my attention
early and that real efforts were made to solve the problem. This will cause
the divorced group member to receive a zero on all group assignments

# Career Assignment

In this class, you are in the process of building your knowledge and
understanding of finance. I want you to use this knowledge wisely in your
future career. To help you explore where and how you plan to use your
education, this assignment asks you to assess your abilities and think about
your future directions. You will be graded on the diligence of your work
rather than on whether I happen to like the direction that you see for
yourself. Understanding yourself and where you would like to go will help you
significantly when the interview season starts in earnest. People who know
what they want and why they deserve it generally tend to do better on the job
market.

**Assignment:** Prepare a paper that is four to seven pages in length (double
spaced) which explains your career aspirations. This paper should have a
section in which you profile your own skills, values (as they are relevant to
your career choice) and personal strengths/weaknesses (as you see them). Then
the paper should have a section in which you choose a job type (e.g. financial
analyst on Wall Street, stock broker, MIS professional at a mutual fund) that
fits your personal profile well. Next, write a section which describes what
this job involves in the way of work, environment, pay and personal
satisfaction. Why would you like to have this job? Why are you (or will be)
qualified for this job? And where would you be likely to work if you took this
type of job?

A good way to start to write this paper is to sit down in a quiet place for an
hour or so without distractions with a pad of paper and write out answers to
the following questions: (1) What am I really good at?, (2) What have I liked
in previous jobs and what have I disliked?, (3) What people do I admire and
why? What about them do I admire?; (4) What do I really want out of a job
(money, recognition, interesting problems to solve, helping others etc.)?

**Resources:** A good way to start the process of writing this paper is to go
through a CD-ROM called Careers Paths in Finance and an [Internet Finance
Career Site](../../osujobs.htm). This program runs on a Macintosh and allows
you to do a personal profile and conduct informational interviews with people
who work in investment banking, commercial banking and corporate finance. To
get into the program check out the CD-ROM from closed reserve in the Page Hall
Library. Then sit down at any Macintosh in Room 3 and insert the CD-ROM into
the CD holder. Then click on the "Bullwinkle" disk. From there, click on the
folder called "Instructional Materials." Then click on the folder called
"Career Paths in Finance." Then click on the middle blue icon which says
something like "Pathsfin95b." Another resource worth consulting (on reserve in
Page Hall) is the Business and Finance Career Directory, Gale Publishing,
1994. You can also search for articles related to your area of interest in
business periodicals, use the career center and contact people in the business
community who already work in the area you are interested in.

## How to View Class Notes in Harvard Graphics

Class notes are available off of the Internet in Harvard Graphics for Windows
3.0 (prs) files. You can download these to your hard disk and view them with a
copy of Harvard Graphics.

Most class notes can be viewed at your leisure on DOS computers in Room 3
Hagerty Hall. The notes are also provided in your reading packet at EZ-Copies.
To use the notes follow these steps:

  * Sit down at any DOS-based computer at the front of the room and make sure that it is running Windows. Click on the folder which says Harvard Graphics. Click on the upward pointing arrow (shown below) which says "Connect to Harvard Graphics."
  * Close this folder by clicking on the tiny rectangle in the upper left hand corner of the box and selecting close. Then click on the folder which says "Finance". You will see the screen below.
  * From this screen double click on any icon that you like. So, if you wanted to review the notes on Financial Markets you would click on the icon called "Financial Markets and Instruments" in the second row. If you get a message which says "Cannot find font" you failed to follow step 1.
  * The effect of clicking on an icon is to load a file into Harvard Graphics. To view the file click on the "screen show icon" highlighted in the upper left hand corner of the image shown below and hit space bar to page through the notes.

* * *

## How to View Multimedia Module in Finance

I have prepared a multimedia module which covers the second week of the course
called "An Overview of Finance." Multimedia is the wave of the future in
education and this module represents an experiment that I would like you to
try out. The module covers introductory concepts and has a number of test
questions like those on the first midterm related to these concepts.

To use this module follow these directions in Room 3 Hagerty Hall:

  * Sit down at any DOS-based computer at the front of the room. Then click on the folder in Windows which says "Finance". You will see the screen below.
  * From this screen double click on the very first icon called "Overview of Finance". You need to be wearing headphones.
  * If you hear no sound try putting your headphones into a different output jack. Also try rebooting for the "Soundblaster" option. See monitor at front of room if trouble persists.

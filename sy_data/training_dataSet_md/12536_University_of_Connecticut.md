intended to achieve this understanding, and to expose students to the most
recent trends in the relevant research. Recent discoveries of fresh data and
the application of more sophisticated techniques have happily been matched by
a growing willingness of specialists to reach out to a wider audience and
apply their research to issues with wider social implications, such as
ethnicity, culture formation, and gender. The topics to be covered in this
course include the labor situation at the beginning of New World colonization,
why Africa supplied New World slave labor, the Middle Passage, the
organization of the trade, its demographic structure, abolition, and impact on
the societies concerned.

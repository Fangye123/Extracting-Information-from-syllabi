**COURSE DESCRIPTION:** This discrete mathematics course is an introduction to
abstract mathematical structures, with special emphasis on theories and
methods relevant to computer science.   General areas of emphasis include:
mathematical reasoning, combinatorial analysis, discrete structures,
applications, and algorithmic thinking, introduction to formal systems and
techniques of proofs, combinatorial versus relational structures, directed and
undirected graphs; Boolean algebra; abstract languages and machines.  Specific
topics will come from the following list: integer arithmetic in different
bases, logic (propositions and truth tables), set theory, functions,
algorithms, matrices, mathematical reasoning, mathematical induction,
recursion, counting techniques (permutations and combinations), recurrence
relations, relations, graph theory, trees, boolean algebra, languages and
grammar, and state transition diagrams.  Students are required to use
calculators in the course.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**[Behavioral objectives](obj272.htm) are the
items/concepts that you are expected to know to satisfactorily complete this
course. They are the items on which you will be tested. Note: It is
anticipated that **students will require a minimum of   6 hours per week
outside of class (homework and study time)** to meet the behavioral objectives
for this course.

**REQUIRED COURSE TEXTBOOK :** The required textbook for this course is **_A
First Course in Discrete Mathematics_** , by John C. Molluzzo and Fred
Buckley, Waveland Press Inc, 1997.

**COURSE SUPPLIES: ** Please bring the textbook, writing implements, paper,
your calculator, your brain, and your sense of humor to every class.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

**COOPERATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT** : Many math students find it is easier to
learn the material by working in a small group. I will assign you to a
4-person **group** , and the group will choose a group leader. After you have
had an opportunity to work with that group, you will then have the opportunity
to decide if you wish to work alone  (as an "Independent Contractor",
henceforth called an "IC" for short) or to continue as a member of this group.
You have until **JANUARY 31, 1999** to make your final decision. Failure to
notify me in writing (e-mail works very well) of your desire to work alone
means that you remain a group member with all the rights and responsibilities
of that group. Group leaders will be responsible for their group's
performance, and hence will grade the group members' participation in the
group case study on a scale of 1-100 %. Group leaders (but NOT independent
contractors) will earn an extra 20 points if their group case study (see
below) is completed in an acceptable fashion.

**[HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS](homework272.htm)** :  For each hour spent in class,
the student is expected to spend two hours out of class doing homework, that
is, 6 hours of homework and studying per week. Homework problems are assigned
for each class lecture topic as specified on the tentative schedule sheet.
Homework will NOT be graded, except if collected and counted as a quiz grade;
homework answers will be reviewed if requested.  Students may work together on
homework assignments, helping each other master the required competencies.
Since MASTERY of the material by each student is what is important, students
should make every attempt to complete homework assignments in a timely
fashion; students are cautioned not to procrastinate.

**QUIZZES : **There will be at least six unannounced (pop) quizzes given
throughout the semester, each worth 20 points.  The best 5 quiz grades will be
counted, making a total of 100 points for quizzes counting toward the final
grade. In other words, if 6 quizzes are given, the lowest quiz grade will be
dropped; if 7 quizzes are given, the lowest 2 quiz grades will be dropped.
There will be NO MAKE-UPS for missed quizzes.

**EXAMS** :  There will be four 100-point in-class, closed-book hour exams,
given on the dates indicated on the [tentative schedule](sched272.htm).  The
student missing an exam may take a MAKE-UP EXAM which will be administered in
class on the Monday of the last week of the semester.  **EXAM "GROUP" BONUS:**
The group (see "Cooperative Learning Environment") or individual that has the
highest average on a quiz or on an exam will receive a bonus equal to the
difference between the high group average (or IC) test grade and the next
highest group average (or IC) test grade.   These bonus points will be added
to each group member's (or IC's) overall grade total.

**GROUP "CASE STUDY" PROBLEM SOLVING** :  The textbook contains numerous Case
Studies, each of which generally includes some history or background
information, some theory, some examples, and some exercises.  Each group and
each independent contractor will be "assigned" a case study in a simple
fashion. First, choice of a specific case study will be allowed. For those
with no preference, -a specific case study will be "drawn from a hat" by the
group leaders and ICs. Each group and each independent contractor will then be
responsible for:

* (1) preparing and giving a 10-15 minute class presentation on that material on the Monday or Wednesday of the last week of the semester, and
* (2) preparing and distributing handouts of the solutions to the exercises associated with that Case Study.
  
The Case Study Project (Presentation & Solutions Handout) will be graded by me
on a scale of 100 points. Group leaders earn "my grade + 20" points (max
grade=120); IC's earn "my grade" points (max grade=100); group members earn
"my grade * group leader % grade" points (max grade=100).  A list of the
**possible Case Study problems** is shown in the table below: Case Study 1A:
Binary Numbers  
Case Study 1B: Floating Point Numbers  
Case Study 1C: Floating Point Arithmetic  
Case Study 1D: Memory Addressing and Data Encoding  
Case Study 2A: Searching and Sorting  
Case Study 3A: Correctness of Algorithms  
Case Study 3B: Introduction to Algorithm Analysis  
Case Study 4A: Random Numbers and Simulation  
Case Study 5A: Computer Functions  
Case Study 5B: Algorithm Analysis: Order of Magnitude  
Case Study 5C: Cryptography  
Case Study 6A: Stacks, Queues, and Deques  
Case Study 6B: Implementation and Comparison of Sorting Algorithms  
Case Study 7A: Switching Theory  
Case Study 8A: Heap Sort  
Case Study 8B: The Critical Path Method (CPM)

**GRADE ENHANCEMENT OPTIONS**

**#1 OPTIONAL INTERNET SEARCH EXERCISE: **The student will provide ten (10)
internet sites that deal with " **Learning Discrete Math"** , specifically
dealing with topics we cover in class or in the textbook, on a [form to be
provided by the instructor](InternetSitesEvaluationForm.htm) (that the student
should print from the internet).  The submitted packet should include [a cover
page](InternetSitesPacketCoverPage.htm) (which should also be printed from the
internet), and for each of the 10 internet sites, a printout of the web page
(showing the URL) and the completed form which comments on the usefulness of
the site to a discrete math student. The comments should include information
about the site, page title, page URL, page summary, date page was last
updated, language of the page and considerable commentary on the page content.
**Submission of the correctly completed Internet site cover page and forms can
either replace 1 quiz grade or add 10 points to a test grade.** But there is a
catch (isn't there always?), and that is the following: only the FIRST person
submitting a specific URL will earn credit for that URL; a duplicate URL (one
that has been submitted earlier by another student) must be replaced with an
"unused" URL to earn full credit.   (Obviously, I will keep a record of the
URLs "used".) So, though the due date for this optional internet search work
will be the Monday of the last week of the semester, the earlier you submit
it, the better your chances are of submitting "unused" URLs.

**#2 OPTIONAL INTERNET WEB PAGE CREATION EXERCISE** : A **group** or an
independent contractor or an individual may design, develop, and implement a
web page entitled:   **_Learning Discrete Math -- A Reference Guide for
College Students_** making use of the Discrete Math URLs identified by
classmates in #1 above (provided by me) or other appropriate URLs identified.
This web page should reside on either of the live web servers _duncan.cup.edu_
or _ryker.aet.cup.edu_   or _sighsy.cup.edu  _ and should contain at least 30
links. **Submission of the URL and a printout of the completed web page can
either replace 2 quiz grades or add 20 points to a test grade (IF the web page
contains no malfunctioning links and no irrelevant links when I test it).**
The due date for this optional internet web page development work will be the
Monday of the last week of the semester.

**COURSE GRADING SCHEME**

**RESULTS:** All grading done in this course will be based on RESULTS, and NOT
on effort. Though an extensive amount of effort is required on the part of the
student, if the effort put forth does not produce results, then for the
purpose of this course, the effort has been spent in vain.

**FINAL GRADES:** Final grades will be determined from the following scale.
**Point Values for Required Activities** `            `4 Exams @ 100 points  =
400 points  
                                      Case Study  = 100 points   
                                Quizzes (best 5) = 100 points

**                                 MAXIMUM Total = 600 points** |  **Final
Grade Determination**  
**540** -    600 points --- A  
**480** - < 540 points --- B  
**420** - < 480 points --- C  
**360** - < 420 points --- D  
000 -< 360 points --- F  
---|---  
  
**GRADES to DATE:** On class days when graded items are returned for
discussion, students will be informed of their individual grade-to-date. This
will provide the student with the information necessary to make course
withdrawal decisions in a timely fashion (see W/WP/WF). Students absent from
class should make timely arrangements to see the instructor to review their
points earned and grade-to-date.

**BORDERLINE FINAL GRADES:** Borderline grade cases will be determined
entirely at the discretion of the instructor. Students who whine at the
instructor when discussing grades guarantee limited consideration of a
borderline case.

**INCOMPLETE:** An "I" grade (incomplete) will be given ONLY in the case of
extenuating circumstances (serious illness of student or death in immediate
family) and only if the course work completed to date is satisfactory (70% or
better). Students who whine at the instructor and expect/ demand an I grade
guarantee limited consideration of their case.

**W/WP/WF:** Withdrawal from a course and grade-to-date go hand in hand.
Students can withdraw with a W grade during the first 6 weeks of the semester,
regardless of percentage grade or corresponding letter grade. However, during
weeks 6-12, withdrawing students receive either a WP if the percentage grade
to date is 70% or better (letter grade of A,B,C) or a WF if the percentage
grade to date is below 70% (letter grade of D,F). Because students cannot for
any reason withdraw after the end of Week 12, attention should be paid to the
methods described earlier for improvement of grades; students should not just
disappear from the instructor's sight.

**CHEATING or ACADEMIC DISHONESTY:** Any student discovered committing an act
of academic dishonesty will receive the grade of F for the course. Academic
dishonesty shall include, but not be limited to:  
  **Cheating on Exams  **  
\--Copying exam answers from another student.  
\--Bringing written notes to class.  
\--Asking someone for the answers to test questions.  
\--Stealing or having in one's possession without permission, any tests,
notes, materials or property belonging to or generating from faculty, staff or
students. | **Cheating on Homework to be counted as a quiz**  
\--Copying the answers from another student.  
\--Asking someone for the answers .  
\--Having another person do the homework for you.  
\--Stealing or having in one's possession with or without permission, any
homework belonging to or generating from faculty, staff or other students. |
**Aiding another student committing an act of academic dishonesty**  
\--Willfully offering to a student, answers or information related to tests or
examinations  
\--Doing another student's assignments.  
\--Taking a test  for another person.

**GENERAL COURSE NOTES**

**SCHEDULE:** The student is responsible for keeping aware of any changes made
by the instructor to the distributed tentative schedule.

**ATTENDANCE:**

* (1) Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes; a record of attendance will be kept by the instructor. The student will be expected to sign a sheet during each class period indicating his/her presence.
* (2) No distinction between excused and un-excused absences (except in prolonged doctor-verified health situations when an Incomplete grade might be justified); the amount of work to be made up as a result of an excused absence versus an un-excused absence is identical.
* (3) No points will be deducted from the final totals for non-attendance; the student is considered to be an adult capable of making his/her own decisions about class attendance.
* (4) Students missing a class where handouts were provided are responsible for obtaining copies of these handouts from the instructor.

  
**RETURN POLICY for SUBMITTED PAPERS:** Any papers submitted for grading (be
they homework assignments, exams printouts, or quizzes) will NOT NECESSARILY
be returned to the student to keep in his possession. They will be returned to
the student and discussed in class, but must then (at the instructor's
discretion) be returned to the INSTRUCTOR'S POSSESSION. Students who are
absent from class on the day graded papers are returned for student perusal
should see the instructor during office hours (or by appointment) to review
graded papers.

**STUDENT RIGHTS and RESPONSIBILITIES:**  
The handout entitled **"[Student Rights and Responsibilities](rights.htm)"**
has been compiled from discussions with many faculty members at many
institutions. The document represents the thoughts and opinions of me
personally; it is NOT to be considered a document which represents a published
policy statement issued by the administration of California University.
**Student rights** , in my opinion, comprise those things which are due to any
student by moral principles; correspondingly, student responsibilities, in my
opinion, represent the particular moral burdens or obligations owed on the
part of the student. It is important to me that students in my classes clearly
understand my feelings on this matter, and thus the document specifically
identifies what I believe are the rights and corresponding responsibilities of
all students.

**ACCOMMODATIONS for STUDENTS with DISABILITIES**  


* **LEARNING DISABILITIES : **Students with learning disabilities work through the [CARE](http://www.itech.cup.edu/~csc201/care/care.htm) Project Office (office location: EDU 110, phone: 938-5781). The accommodation request form should be completed and submitted to the professor to acknowledge the accommodation arrangements. Faculty may contact the CARE Project Office to confirm that the accommodation has been approved based on the student's documentation and that the arrangements are appropriate.
  


* **ALL OTHER DISABILITIES : **Students requiring special considerations must get in touch with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (office location: Room 114 Clyde Hall, phone: 938-4012). The Office of Services for Students with Disabilities will notify the instructor in writing of the accommodations you need in compliance with 504/ADA.

**MCDB 4650 Developmental Biology**  
**Spring 2001**  
Instructors: Kevin Jones, Jennifer Knight, and Mark Dubin Welcome!

The class meets 11:00 a.m. MWF in Ekeley Science E1B20. For general
information about the class, see the following
[link](../lec2/geninfodevo2001.html). The tentative syllabus follows.

    If you want to read ahead in the text for the lectures and we haven't yet posted notes, follow the link to the 2000 course page below and look for the similarly titled lecture. Regarding printing the pages: I use a Mac and find that if I set the "Scale" to 80% using "Page Setup..." under the "File" menu while I'm running Netscape, the pages fit within the printer margins. If you have other tricks for making sure browser  pages fit within printer margins, or instructions for printing with a Wintel PC, let us know and we'll post them for your classmates.

Note:  Browsers commonly cache pages, thus you may see an old version of this
page unless you reload it.

   _This site will be under construction throughout the course of the
semester._ Lecture notes containing the majority of the material discussed in
class will be posted on this site but these notes should not be considered
complete; at times additional material will be discussed. You are encouraged
to attend class and ask questions to obtain the whole picture! These notes are
prepared for you by your instructors to give an overview of most of the
material presented, relieving some of your burden of taking detailed notes and
hopefully freeing you to spend more time thinking about the material during
lecture. Reading assignments in the text for the course, Developmental Biology
(6th edition) by Scott Gilbert, will also be given. The combination of the
material presented in class and the readings in this text will give you
glimpses of a fascinating story- the story of your own creation from two
haploid cells.

    We will also sometimes provide links to other websites you can use as aids to help understand a subject, or to explore it more deeply. Many of these sites will be rich in graphics and you will find them most enjoyable if you use a fast computer and fast ethernet connection to view them (e.g. in the library). You are encouraged to explore Developmental Biology on the Web yourself, and if you find a site you believe is useful for the class, please email the URL to the instructor teaching that lecture (see below), we'll put links that look useful up for your class!

    The lecture notes for this class will be derived from notes prepared in the past by William Wood, Lois Abbott, Jenny Knight and Kevin Jones. In Spring 2000, Wood and Knight taught a class quite similar to the one you are taking. The website for that class, including the accompanying notes, has been kept active to give you the opportunity to look ahead at notes similar- and in many cases identical- to the notes that will accompany the Spring 2001 lectures. However, be aware that in an effort to improve the lectures, and to inform you of new and exciting progress in this rapidly changing field, there will be changes!!! As the notes are revised, the links above will become active. Note also that we are now using a new, updated textbook. The lecture notes are the property of William Wood, Kevin Jones, Jenny Knight, and Lois Abbott and are to be treated as copyrighted material.

[The Spring 2000 MCDB 4650 Website](http://www.Colorado.EDU/MCDB/MCDB4650/) \-
contains notes similar but NOT identical to the notes for this class!

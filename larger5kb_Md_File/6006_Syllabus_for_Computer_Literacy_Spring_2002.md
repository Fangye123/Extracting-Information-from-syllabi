**Style/Mode of Teaching:  **

This is a laboratory class.  The instructor will explain a new lab assignment
at the beginning of the each class time.  You will then be able to work on
that lab during the time of the rest of the class.  The instructor and a
Teaching Assistant will be available to help you with any problems that you
may have with the assignment.  If you are having some problems, you may also
come to see me during my office hours.  The weekly lab assignments and the
projects  will be listed on the Web at <http://www.cs.okstate.edu/cs1003/>.
Just click on the Weekly Assignments or the Projects options.

### **Laboratory Assignment Due Dates:**

You will work on one different assignment each day you are in class. The two
that you do one week will be due on the first day of class for the next week.
Those in the Monday/Wed. class will turn in their labs from the first week on
Monday of the second week, etc.  Those in the Tues/Thurs. class will turn in
their labs from the first week on Tuesday of the second week, etc.  Whatever
is covered in one week will be due the next week.  

Laboratory assignments may be turned in up to one week late, but they lose a
certain amount of points after the first week.    The labs are considered late
if they are not turned in on the Monday or Tuesday at class time of the week
when they are due.  This is the point schedule:

On time...........................  | 0% off --Lab is worth 15 pts  
---|---  
Up to 1 week late...........  | 15% off --Lab is worth 10 points  
More than 1 week late  | 100% off --Lab is worth 0 points

### **Examinations:**

There are no examinations in this course.  However, there will be quizzes
given during the course.  See information on quizzes.

### **Hardware/Software Requirements:**

All hardware and software needed for this course are available in MSCS 108 as
well as other computer labs around campus.  Students can use their computers
at home if the software is the same.  Sometimes other versions of Microsoft
Products that are not the 2000 version that we will be using are not always
compatible and will cause students problems.

### **Class Attendance:**

Attendance is not required, but is strongly encouraged. Students are
responsible for all material covered in class.  It is always easier to learn
the material by both seeing and hearing a demonstration on the topic and then
doing an assignment on the topic.  Since explanations are given about the lab
assignments at the beginning of the class time, it is important to be on time
to class.   If you are ill or there is some other reason that you cannot
attend a class, please notify the instructor.

### **Quizzes:**

   Quizzes will be unannounced.  They will  be given after an assignment for
the day  has been covered in class.   You will be able to use your labs, books
or the computer to answer the questions to the quizzes.  

**Quizzes cannot be made up if they are missed.**

### **Projects:**

Projects will be assigned during the semester.   They will be given to you in
class after you have finished learning some particular area.

  * The first one will consist of finding information on the Internet that you will later use for the rest of the projects. 
  * The second project will consist of writing a two to three  page paper on the topic that you researched on the Internet. This will be at the end of the Word labs. 
  * The third one will include adding a chart to your report. This will be an Excel chart that will be added to a Word document.  This will be at the end of the Excel labs.  
  * The fourth one will be a PowerPoint project.  It will be putting together a presentation from the written document in the second project.   

Projects are due at the beginning of the class period on the date that they
are due.   You will lose 5 points a day on projects not turned in on time.
After 5 days, the projects will NOT be accepted.  

Your final project will be due at the time when your final exam for this class
is scheduled.   These are:

        Section 1  (Monday/Wednesday class)      Wednesday, Friday, May 10   10:30-12:20.  
        Section 2 (Tuesday/Thursday class)      Wednesday, May 8  at 8:30-10:20.

### **Collaboration Policy:**

_

Laboratory assignments_ _and Projects_ :  Discussion of any kind is allowed.
After discussion each student must write up his/her own solution. Copying
another student's work is not allowed. Giving another student your work is
considered cheating as well.

### Course Description:

  
This course will explore the cultural context in which the so-called Romantic
Movement prospered, and will attempt to reconfigure inherited notions of
Romanticism by re-examining the vexed relationship between the period's most
notorious popular genre (Gothic fiction and drama) and the poetic production
of its canonical and emerging poets. Most fundamentally, this course will
address the question of why, given the preponderance of gothic motifs in
Romantic poetry, has the gothicism of this poetry remained largely unexplored
territory in modern critical accounts of Romanticism. In confronting this
question, we will be exploring issues of canonization, periodization, and of
how culture is constituted, marketed, disseminated, and defined. We will also
be attempting to rethink some key relationships that have received
considerable critical attention in the last decade: between gender and
authorship, between literary categories and social categories, between notions
of literary transgression and cultural transgression.

## Requirements:

### Reading:

  
I have set up the readings initially into a Primary/Secondary format, since I
want to begin by concentrating on the gothic fiction from which our sense of
gothic is usually derived. By the middle of the course, however, I hope that
we will begin to find the critical and source materials often as interesting
as the fiction, drama, and poetry. The readings are intentionally heavier
early in the course, and become lighter as we move on.

### Weekly Responses:

  
This course requires you to be on e-mail, since part of the weekly preparation
for our meetings will be for you to write a weekly response that you will send
to the e-mail address gamer550@dept.english.upenn.edu. These responses will be
due on Tuesday, by noon, beginning on September 19 (week three). They
constitute the single most important part of the course, since they will be
the basis from which we begin our discussions, and will play a key role in my
sense of your involvment and performance in the course. You will also find, if
you look on your e-mail before you compose your response, that many times the
responses of your colleagues will prove to be as much a catalyst to your own
writing as the reading itself. Before class on Thursday, then, you will be
required to read through the responses, and to print them up and bring them
in. So, for weeks 3-11 (until Thanksgiving), this will be our weekly schedule:
responses due by noon Tuesday, reading and printing of responses done by the
time we meet as a class on Thursday.

### The Short Presentation:

  
Once during the semester, I am going to ask you to do a 5-7 minute
presentation on a periodical in the period, focusing particularly on the
relation between that periodical's political and social position in British
literary culture and how it reviews gothic fiction and drama in general, and
our text for that week in particular. During that week, you are not required
to do a response on the class listserver, though you're welcome to contribute
to that discussion if you would like to do so. I promise to stop anyone who
goes over seven minutes.

### The Final Paper:

  
Rather than having you write an article-length essay of 25 or more pages, I am
instead assigning a conference paper of _no more than_ 2500 words, which you
will give at our final meeting, which will take place in the form of a proper
conference in Penniman Lounge at 3 p.m. Your paper titles, and a 1-2 page
abstract, are due on November 30. I will attempt, as far as I am able, to
organize them into panels for our conference. If you would like to organize
your own panels of three papers, I absolutely welcome and encourage you to do
so. As conference papers are usually abbreviated or skeletal versions of an
article, you should expect this final assignment to require significant
research and your utmost care in the formulating of its argument. For your
abstract and for your paper, I will make practical suggestions regarding
various issues of professionalization ("How does one write an abstract?"), as
well as responding to your argument and presentation with an eye toward how to
revise your paper into an article.

> ### The Dissolution of the Monasteries

>

> The dissolution of the monasteries almost completely obliterated monasticism
in England. Several Benedictine cathedral priories built during the Norman
period were converted to cathedrals with a dean and a chapter of canons in the
English Reformation. These include [Gloucester
Cathedral](http://www.softdata.co.uk/cathedra.htm), built in the late
fourteenth century; [Ely Cathedral
](http://www.cathedral.ely.anglican.org/)(see also the [City of Ely's web
site)](http://www.ely.org.uk/), begun in 1090; [Chester
Cathedral](http://www.chestercathedral.org.uk/) (no photos on the web site),
from the late thirteenth century; [Durham
Cathedral](http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dla0www/c_tour/tour.html), begun in 1093 to
house the relics of St. Cuthbert; [Norwich
Cathedral](http://www.cathedral.org.uk/), begun in 1096 (see also
<http://www.norwich.gov.uk/tourism/churches/cathedral.html> and [The Mapping
Margery Kempe
database](http://sterling.holycross.edu/departments/visarts/projects/kempe/parish/norwich.htm)
which charts her travels to Norwich described in the _Book of Margery Kempe_
); [St. Albans Cathedral](http://www.stalbanscathedral.org.uk/), begun in
1077; [Perterborough Cathedral](http://www.citygate.demon.co.uk/cathedrl/),
begun in 1117 and which houses the tomb of Catherine of Aragon; and
[Winchester Cathedral](http://www.win.diocese.org.uk/cathedral.html), which
houses the relics of Cnut.

###  OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS (Course Requirements)

ARCH 4443 - History of the American Built Environment  
Prerequisite: END 2413 and 2423 or permission of the instructor

Survey of the American built environment from initial settlement and
subsequent European colonization through the middle of the twentieth century.
The integral nature of the built environment, the unique characteristics of
the American frontier, and the heterogeneous nature of the American culture
will be emphasized. Buildings, urban patterns and ideas will be studied,
supported by examples ranging from the recognized standards to the
commonplace.

To succeed in this course, the two most important things you can do are to
read the text and attend class, in that order. The reading is intended to give
you a base of information which provides the context for material presented in
class. I will assume that you have read the text and so will not necessarily
repeat basic information in lectures (that is not what they are for).

Attendance is required for two reasons. First and foremost, visual information
will be presented in class that is not available in your text (and, in some
cases, not in any text) so that the only way you can get all the information
is by coming to class. Secondly, I have noticed a correlation between
attendance and success in tests. This is particularly true for people who
ATTEND, that is, stay awake, are actively involved in viewing the buildings,
are thinking about what they are seeing and ASK QUESTIONS when they are
uncertain about the information or ideas presented. Now, everyone gets sick or
has a day when life seems too wonderful to waste or too dreadful to face, so
three (3) unexcused absences are overlooked. After that you may pay a price
because I will go to attendance sheets where final grades are borderline and
consistent attendance indicates a degree of interest which deserves to be
recognized.

The textbook will be considered the authority for basic factual information
for buildings such as dates and name spellings. All textbooks interpret the
facts as well as present them. While Leland Roth's book is the most unbiased
history of United States architecture that I have found, I reserve the right
to disagree with his interpretations. In the event that I present a different
interpretation, you will want to know which of us you must believe. The answer
is: neither. You should make up your own mind, which may involve a third
interpretation: YOURS. Please do believe that all interpretations are
acceptable, so long as they are supported by the facts.

If you miss a class, do not rely solely on the textbook to catch up. I
recommend that you borrow class notes from two classmates and then review what
you find there in the various sources listed under Recommended Reading. You
may also want to consult these sources if you want to know more about any of
the buildings, architects or issues discussed in class.

Four components will comprise your grade in the course: quizzes (20%), a mid-
term exam (15%), a final exam (25%) and a term project (40%).

Quizzes (dates are listed in the syllabus) cover your reading in A Concise
History of American Architecture . They are objective and intended to keep you
reading and studying what you read. If you miss a quiz, you may make it up
only before the date of the next quiz. It is YOUR responsibility to arrange
with me for the make-up. There is also the possibility of unannounced quizzes
in any and all class periods.

The mid-term and final exams (equaling 40% of your grade) will generally be a
combination of objective and essay questions. They will cover material from
both class presentation and the textbook. The purpose of the tests is to make
you think about what you have learned. They test your ability to organize,
support and communicate your thoughts.

The term project involves compiling the history and interpretation of a
building. The project is intended to increase your awareness of the range and
nature of the "facts" of architecture and to enhance your ability to discern
significant architectural issues and interpret them through those facts. It is
also intended to expand your knowledge of the methods of architectural
research and scholarly writing. Because these skills are at least as important
as any facts you will take away from the class, the project grade is given
equal weight with the test grades.

Speaking of grades: I beg you to remember that grades do not measure what you
know or can do. They measure what you know or can do in relation to what I
think you should know or be able to do. In this sense any grade is not an
absolute but a communication between me and you. When I evaluate your tests
and papers, I do not take points off, I add them on. It is important to me
that you understand what the letter grades used in the course mean.

C is the base-line grade. On an objective, 100 point scale, it means that at
least 70% of the information you have given is correct. It means you have
satisfied all the requirements in an acceptable manner. This represents the
basic expectation of the course (the average that everyone is expected to
achieve).

B indicates above average work (80-90%). It means that you have shown
qualities of thought and/or performance that exceed basic expectations.

A indicates exceptional work (90-100%). It means that you have shown qualities
of thought and/or performance that far exceed basic expectations. (We do well
to remember that there is relatively less exceptional work in the world.)

D indicates below average work (60-70%). This means that you have not
satisfied all requirements in an acceptable manner.

F indicates work well below average (less than 60%). It means that you have
failed to satisfy all the requirements in an acceptable manner.

If, at any time, you have questions about requirements, expectations or
grades, please come and see me. I am aware that I am asking you to work in
ways that are unfamiliar and to think about material that is new to you. I
want you to understand what is required of you. I do NOT want you to assume
that you are simply doing more of what you have always done. I should like to
think that this course is challenging in ways that will bring out your best
work. (That means I think it is a hard course.) But I would also like to think
that it is as hard to fail the course as it is to do well.

If you have any disability which would prevent your satisfying the
requirements of the course, please see me as soon as possible so that
accommodation can be arranged.

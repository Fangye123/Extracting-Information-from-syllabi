_Course Organization_

  * Office Hours: Monday afternoon 5:20-6:20PM Krasnow Rm 224 or as arranged. 
  * Class is a combination of lecture/discussion
  * Check back here often for changes and additions!
  * Check back to this web page often for updates on lectures, links, and assorted other useful material including the exams. 
  * 15 min break at 8:20PM 
  * grade: 25% class participation; 25% midterm, 50% final exam (open book)
  * Make up exams will also be open book but will be substantially more challenging 
  * You should attend as many of the Krasnow Monday Afternoon seminars as possible. More information available[ **here**](http://www.gmu.edu/departments/krasnow/monday_seminars.htm).
  * Information about a new course [Computer Generation of Virtual Brains](../ascoli/Teaching/Psyc892/index.htm) scheduled for next semmester

_Course Description_

Memory has been described as a relatively permanent change in a animal's
behavior as a result of experience. The past one hundred years of research
into learning and memory have, however, greatly expanded our understanding of
the biological substrates of this process. As a result, today, the above
purely behavioral definition does little justice to how we understand the
complex sequence of biochemical and biophysical interactions that together,
result in memory storage within nerve cells. This course will focus on the
mnemonic process at this molecular level, all the while mindful of the
emergent properties of ensembles of nerve cells which together produce our
internal perception of a memory.

The course will consist of handouts (available at this website before the
weekly class meeting), text readings, a midterm and a final exam. While there
are no set pre-requisites for admission, students will need to be open to
thinking about and eventually using the language of modern neuroscience which
includes concepts of: physics, chemistry, molecular and cell biology and above
all mathematics. In other words, physics for poets this course isn't.

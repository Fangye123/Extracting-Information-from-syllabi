### **Course Description**

This is an intermediate course in macroeconomic theory, with an emphasis on
_theory._ This does _not_ mean that the course will be highly abstract, and
won't have anything to do with real world economic problems. Rather, it means
that we take as a starting point the view that there is no single truth in
macroeconomics, hence everything we'll learn will have to be regarded as
_theory._

We will be supplementing a 'serious' textbook with a fun book on the history
of economics. In addition, we will be reading a few classic texts by famous
economists, that illustrate their main theoretical disagreements and debates.
These texts may sometimes be obscure, but are often quite fascinating: you
will find economists passionately defending their views, and attacking those
of others. The aim of reading these texts is to gain a sense of the origins of
the macroeconomic theories that are now presented as textbook truth, but that
were quite revolutionary when they were first introduced.  
  
The main questions we will focus on include the following:

    * How do markets emerge? 
    * Does involuntary unemployment exist? 
    * What explains business cycles? 
    * Is money neutral? 
    * Why do economies grow? 
    * Why are some countries rich and others poor? 
    * How do people's expectations affect the economy?   
  
If you would like to be given a single answer to each of these questions, this
class is not for you. If, instead, you think you might enjoy learning about a
number of different theories, and the fights that have been fought over them,
I would encourage you to take this class. In the end, I would like you to have
a basic understanding of the main macroeconomic theories that exist, and I
will leave it to you to decide between them.

### **Grading**

There will be weekly problem sets, one midterm exam, an essay, and a final.
Grades will be calculated as follows:  
  
Problem Sets | 15%  
---|---  
Midterm | 25%  
Essay | 25%  
Final | 35%  

  

### **Lecture Notes**

Since some students complained about the amount of writing they had to do
during lectures last semester, I will experiment this semester with putting
some notes on the web. In as far as possible, they will be posted in advance
(by the evening before lecture at the latest), so as to allow you to print
them out before coming to class, and use them as a guide for taking your own
notes. Since they are only a summary of the main points, they should in no way
be used as a substitute for going to lecture or for reading the required
readings.

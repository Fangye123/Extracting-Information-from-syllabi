**TROPICAL FIELD ECOLOGY  
EEOB H557  
GENERAL COURSE SYLLABUS**

  
**Instructor:**  
Dr. Peter Curtis  
Dept. Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology  
  
**Course facilitators:**  
The Organization for Tropical Studies  
San Pedro de Montes de Oca  
Costa Rica

**Overview and objectives.**  
This course is intended to give students a firsthand knowledge of tropical
biology and the issues surrounding conservation of biodiversity in a third
world country. It does so in the context of an intensive foreign study tour in
Costa Rica. The course includes travel to three distinct tropical forest
habitats, independent field experimentation and oral presentation of results,
guided natural history exploration, and interaction with local and
international agricultural and ecotourism concerns. The three sites and major
associated activities are:

The La Selva Biological Preserve (lowland wet forest).  
¡ì Introduction to tropical flora and fauna.  
¡ì Field projects and oral presentations.  
¡ì Tour of a banana plantation and a local women's medicinal plant collective.

Palo Verde National Park (seasonally dry forest).  
¡ì Visit to Volcan Arenal National Park (enroute)  
¡ì Field projects and oral presentations.  
¡ì Co-evolution between plants and animals.

Monteverde Cloud Forest (high elevation wet forest).  
¡ì Canopy ecology.  
¡ì Community engagement in tropical conservation.  
¡ì Discussion of ecotourism in the Monteverde cloud forests.

**Enrollment.**  
Honors standing and permission of instructor. 3 credit hours, EEOB 413.01
prerequisite. This course is limited to 15 students. Participants will enroll
in IS 697 (International Studies) for Spring Quarter and course credit will be
transferred to EEOB H557. Enrollment in IS 697 requires a $100 dollar
registration fee paid to the Office of International Education. Additional
costs are ca. $500 that will be added to the student's Spring Quarter fee
statement covering room, board, and travel in Costa Rica, and ca. $800 for
round trip airfare from Columbus, Ohio to San Jos e, Costa Rica.

**Course structure.**  
There will be three mandatory class meetings during Winter Quarter, in the
third, ninth, and tenth week of classes and two class meetings during Spring
Quarter, in the second and fifth week of classes. All other formal class
meetings will take place in Costa Rica, between Wednesday of Winter Quarter
finals week and Sunday at the end of spring break (12 days total). In addition
to activities taking place in Costa Rica, students will complete two
scientific reports of field experiments following their return to Ohio. Final
grades will be assigned based on level of participation in Costa Rica (35 pts
possible) and on the two project reports (65 pts possible).  
Grading scale (%): 100 - 92 = A, 91-90 = A-, 89-87 = B+, 86-83 = B, 82-80 =
B-, 79-77 = C+, 76-73 = C,  
72-70 = C-, 69-67 = D+, 66-63 = D,  < 63 = E.

**Independent Field Projects**. The following are field exercises that have
been tested in the field in Costa Rica and can be undertaken by students.
However, students will be free to suggest new projects.

La Selva:  
1\. A comparitive study of treefall dynamics in tropical primary forests. I.  
2\. Diurnal mammal populations at La Selva.  
3\. Protection against invading vines: a study of palm defense mechanisms.  
4\. Palm diversity as a measurement of regeneration for a tropical rainforest
in Costa Rica.  
5\. Deceit mimicry among Begonias of La Selva.

Palo Verde:  
1\. A comparitive study of treefall dynamics in a primary tropical forests.
II.  
2\. Foraging behavior of Howler Monkeys in relation to body mass.  
3\. Acacia collinsii defense by two ant species.  
4\. Inter vs. intra-specific aggression among ants.  
5\. Migratory bird habitat preference in the Palo Verde marsh.

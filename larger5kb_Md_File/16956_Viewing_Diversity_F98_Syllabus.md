**_On Tuesdays, all three classes will meet together in RO137 . On Thurdays,
classes will meet individually in assigned classrooms._**  
  
  
  

The focus for the Fall Quarter will be " **Culture and Diversity**." We will
examine diversity in relation to the concepts of culture, ethnicity, society,
and identity. We explore how these concepts are culturally constructed and
then studied from various social science perspectives. Representations of
diversity in America will be drawn from various media (literature, cinema,
over T.V. and on the Internet).

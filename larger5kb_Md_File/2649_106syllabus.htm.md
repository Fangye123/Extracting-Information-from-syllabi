This course will look at the historical development of selected world
civilizations over a period of several hundred years during the modern age--
1750 to the present. It will provide an overview of many different peoples and
nationalities and put them in the context of; revolutions of various kinds,
changes in social structures and economic systems, imperialism, world wars and
their aftermath, and movements of the late 20th century. Through lectures,
readings, films, and discussion, I hope you have a better understanding of the
peoples, concepts, and ideas that are shaping our world today.  
  
**Exams, Quizzes and Grading:** Your final grade will be based on the average
of the results of four equally weighted scores:

25% final exam--multiple choice and short answer

**Term Paper/Book Review Instructions**  
  
This is to be a book review, not a book report. A report tells the contents of
the book--  
this is a story about...--wjile a review analyzes a book according to the
following criteria. No grade above a "D" will be given for a "report."  
  
Read the entire book (this includes title page, introduction, preface,
acknowledgements, main body, end notes, footenotes, index, appendixes.
glossary, and whatever else is printed.)  
  
**Specific Instructions:** The review should be divided intoe four parts as
follows:  
FOLLOW THESE STEPS! Write in narrative/essay form--not outline. **Do not**
write in first person.  
  
1\. Author What are her/his qualifications? who are they? What is their
background? Professional status? Political, religious, philosohical
afilliations? Does the author have a purpose?  
  
2\. Scope and Content of the Book: What objectives has the author set out for
their  
selves? (Preface or Introduction) What aspects, event/s, time period or phases
have they focused on? Give a brief summary of  
the topics, periods, and/or personalities and peoples dealt with in  
the book. What is the central theme/s of the book? Does the author come to any
general conclusions?  
  
3\. Physical Description: Possible things to look for are: How is the book
divided, organized? Sections? Chapters? Topically? Chronologically?  
Collection of essays? Pictures? Maps? Footnotes? Bibliography?  
Index? Is the type readable?  
  
4\. Evaluation: This is your original contribution. It is asking for your
opinion and critical analysis of the book. You can praise the book as well as
criticize it, but you must support your critiques--good or bad--with examples.  
  
Evaluate in terms of:  
_Style-_ Was it well-written, interesting, well-organized, repititious,
obscure, tedious, witty; or partly all of that? Ask yourself if you enjoyed
the book. Try to answer why, or why not. Use examples to illustrate.  
  
_Content-_ What were its strong and weak points? Did the author  
accomplish what they intended? Is the central theme/s valid? Did  
the author use evidence with care and discrimination? Does the author follow
through with an idea? Again, use examples.  
  
_Bias, if any-_ Did the author have a special point of view? Did he or she
make judgements, evaluations, or criticisms? Did the author support those
critiques? Give examples--use a quote if possible.  
  
_General Contributions-_ Did the book treat a subject hitherto slighted or
ignored? Did it offer new insights into a subject or  
time period--new interpretation of an old subject?  
  
_Your general opinion-_ Did you learn anything new? Did it change your mind
about anything or did it stir you do think about something in a different way?
If so, what?  
  
_Comparative Reviews:_ Use the  Book Review Digest in the Library to find the
location of other book reviews on the book. In the Digest, you will find
capsule summaries of reviews under the author's name, or editor, and title of
the book. If possible, go to the actual review and read it in its entirety.
Write a brief comment about these reviews at the end of your paper. Do you
agree, or disagree? Why? If you can not find any, tell me where you looked.  
  
**Style and Format of Review:** There should be a title page on which the
bibliographical information is centered. Include your name on the title page,
also.  
  
Erich Maria Remarque,  All Quiet on the Western Front,  
New York: Fawcett Crest Books. 1966, 175 pp.  
A Book Review by "Your Name"  
  
Your paper needs to be double-spaced with one-inch margins. The paper should
not be less than three pages or more than five. On the last page of your
review-essay, neatly spaced in the bottom right-hand corner should be your
neam and the date of composition of the paper. Staple it together in the upper
left-hand corner. No folders or covers please.  
  
Each of the above parts of these intructions are not designed to be a
checklist fo what you will write in your review. Some of the questions may not
apply to every book, or author. They are question for reading the book, And,
they will provide direction and ideas about what to include when writing a
book review. This project is meant to sharpen your analytical sense, add to
your knowledge, and let you explore an area of this course at greater depth.
NOTE: do not use terms such as; this was a "good book," it was "well written,"
the author seems to write "well," he/she has some "good ideas," I found it
"very interesting." Alone, these general terms mean nothing--be prepared to
give examples to illustrate what you mean.  
  
  
  
  
**Inserting Quotations into Your Text:** If you bring up points of praise,
criticism,  
and you need to illustrate further with quotes and examples there are hard and
fast rules for inserting quoted material into the body of your text.  
  
If your quotation runs to five lines of more, this is the way it should appear
in your text:  
  
  
Dr. Limerick, a professor of history at the University of Colorado, challanges
the  
  
nationalistic and ethnocentric Turner Thesis and its arbitrary limits of time
and space.  
  
The conquest of Western America shapes the present...  
dramatically. To live with that legacy Americans ought  
to be well informed and well warned...so as not to be  
caught off guard by the continued vitality of issues widely  
believed to be dead (p.18).  
  
  
  
If you quotation runs less than five lines, it should appear in your text this
way:  
  
  
  
Her solutions: Center the study of Western history around the "contest for
property and profit" into the conflicts between cultures, religion, and
language. Look at the frontier as a location, not a process. "Reorganized, the
history of the West is a study of a place undergoin conquest and never fully
escaping its consequences" (p. 26).  
  
  
  
No quotations are used in the first instance. The indenting 10 spaces and
single-spacing of the material indicates it is a quotation. In the same
instance, note the use of the three-spaced dots. If it is desired to omit any
part of the sentence you quote, indicate the omission by placing three-spaced
dots between the fragments. Your quotes need to flow with, and fit well, with
your text.

The following pages are study guides for you to help focus your reading of
each chapter in your textbook. Identify and understand the meaning or
historical significance of the terms listed for each chapter. There are also
questions for discussion from each chapter. We will try to devote some class
time each week for discussion. Please come prepared.

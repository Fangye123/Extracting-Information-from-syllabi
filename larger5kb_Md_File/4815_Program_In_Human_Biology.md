Bio 193:  Journal Club  
Bio 193 is a one-unit class offered S/NC.  Journal clubs are an excellent  
way to dig into the primary research literature and learn about the  
cutting edge of a field.  They are also an opportunity to practice  
preparing and giving a presentation to a friendly, small group.  The  
discussions should be lively and fun!  Tuesdays 12:05-1:05  
***Section 01, Exploring Genetic Model Systems, will be a rapid tour of  
many of the amazingly diverse organisms that Stanford faculty use as  
models to study important biological problems. To sign up contact Dr.  
Kristin Black (kblack@leland)  
***Section 02, Ecological Interactions, will be an introduction to current  
and historical research on species interactions in ecological communities.  
Topics include competition, predation, mutualism, herbivory, pollination,  
and multi-species interactions. To sign up contact Nathan Sanders  
(sanders@ants)  


Issues in Public Service, A Winter Quarter 2000 Debut!  
Issues in Public Service (Political Science 159R, 5 units), a public  
service education course for Frosh and Sophomores will debut this winter  
quarter 2000.  This course taught by, Assistant Professor Robert Reich  
(Political Science, Ethics in Society), will introduce students to the  
history of public service in the United States and moral and ethical  
dilemmas people encounter when "doing" service.  For more information  
about the course please contact: Assistant Professor Rob Reich,  
reich@leland or Heather Ramirez, hramirez@leland.

Society, Human Biology, Public Policy and Urban Studies  


Spring Quarter Course:  HB 032-Q  
How  do you decide what courses to take,  what career to pursue ?  How do  
you  know if your choices are right ?What if you  feel at a loss in  
deciding  anything? What are the short  and long term consequences of  
these choices? The seminar will address these questions and related  
concerns from two perspectives.  We will first consider some theories  and  
studies which address these matters  in general.  Then we  will focus  
more specifically on how Stanford  undergreduates make these choices  
based on a longitudinal study of a sample of Stanford undergraduates  and  
its ten year follow -up.  The factors we will  look at will include  
gender; ethnicity; social class ; and relationships with parents , faculty  
and peers as well as a special typology that  was designed for this study.  
The ten  year follow -up study will  then be used to examine the outcome  
of these choices with respect to career patterns   and measures of career  
success and satifaction (compensation,  contentment, commttment and  
competence. Finally we will examine the relationship of careers to  
personal life with respect marriage, parenthood.  and  intellectual and  
social interests."  Instructor:  Herant Katchadourian

Undergraduate Research in Conservation Biology  
Join a research project that is documenting the importance of native bee  
pollinators for selected crop species, and the influence of habitat  
fragmentation on the diversity and abundance of these pollinator species.  
The field work is being carried out in farms and oak woodland, chapparal  
and riparian habitats near Davis, California.

Two positions are available for juniors who would like to conduct honors  
projects in Biology, Human Biology or Earth Sciences (IIS) and who are  
willing to commit at least one year to working part-time on this project  
for research credit.  In winter quarter,  students will conduct directed  
reading and develop their own research proposal for submission to URO for  
funding. In the spring, students will learn field techniques, field-test  
research protocols, and then carry out the research at Davis during the  
summer. Students will analyze their data, learn and use skills in  
Geographic Information Systems, and write up their honor's thesis during  
the fall and winter of the second year.

STEP Program  
The Stanford Teacher Education Program (STEP) aims to prepare powerful  
teachers who can help diverse learners reach challenging learning goals.  
STEP helps participants become more aware of their educational values and  
more proficient in their subject matter, while broadening their  
pedagogical knowledge. Prospective teachers become equipped to make  
educational choices based on an improved understanding of learning,  
teaching, curriculum and assessment, as well as a greater knowledge of  
themselves, their students, their professional and pedagogical goals, and  
the educational context of their decisions.  STEP promotes these ideas in  
academic work and in practical training.

STEP offers a twelve-month (summer plus an academic year) Master of Arts  
in Education program to prepare college graduates in the humanities and  
sciences for careers as secondary teachers.  As part of the School of  
Education at Stanford, STEP students have an unusual opportunity to  
combine practical and theoretical preparation.

For more information, please visit our website:  
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/SUSE/navigation/programsnavfrm.html  or  
contact the STEP office (650) 723-4891, susanb@leland.

**Requirements:**

**Exams and Papers:**  
You will be asked to write two papers for the course. The first will be a
short 6-8 page paper and the second a longer 10-12 page paper. A number of
topics will be given to you to choose from but you may submit your own topic
for approval (at least two weeks before the due date). There will be no
midterm exam. A brief short answer final exam will be given at the end of the
semester aiming to verify your reading of the assigned texts.

**Attendance/Participation:**  
It is very important that you attend all scheduled lectures in order to keep
up with the material. However, three absences will be excused. If you have
more than three absences, a considerable percentage (15%) will be subtracted
from your final grade.

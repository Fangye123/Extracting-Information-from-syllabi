COURSE DESCRIPTION

**

In this course, we will study some of the major works of English and
continental literature from the Renaissance through the eighteenth century. As
part of our exploration, we will discuss the political, cultural, and
intellectual history that went into the shaping of art and literature during
these periods. We will also examine the central aesthetic concerns of
Renaissance and eighteenth-century artists and writers.

Great literature provokes us to think deeply about ourselves and the world
around us. And as students of literature, we, too, have our responsibilities:
we must take the time to read literary works with care and thoughtfulness; we
must engage their ideas forcefully and with conviction in discussion with
others; we must seek truly to know them. In Literature 322, we will therefore
practice the skills of the close reading of literary texts and the equally
important skills of in-class discussion. We will practice, as well, the
elements of powerful critical writing about the literature we read. A major
research assignment will assist students in developing their abilities in
going beyond the text itself to engage the ideas of literary critics,
historians and scholars.

REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES

**_

Exams_: Two exams, a combination of objective answer and essay questions,
requiring a critical knowledge of the readings. (150/250=400 pts.)

_

Papers_: Two essays, typed, double-spaced and stapled, using the MLA format.
The first will be a five-page paper requiring the close reading of a text. The
second paper will be 10-12 pages and will require research. All writing for
this course should be free of grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors.
Late papers will be accepted, but reduced by a full letter-grade equivalent
for each day late, including weekends and holidays. Also, I do not write
comments on late papers. Please talk to me _in advance_ if you need an
extension. (150/300=450 pts.)

_

Research paper assignments_: Students will complete a research paper proposal,
a working bibliography, and other exercises as assigned (50 pts.)

_

Reading quizzes, assignments, etc._: Several unannounced objective-answer or
essay quizzes, requiring a reading knowledge of the assignments. You may not
make up a quiz if you are absent on the day it is given. Also, occasional
written assignments may be given (to be typed and double spaced, unless
assigned as in-class writing). (100 pts.)

_

Participation_: Essential.

_

Attendance_: Our course format (mostly discussion) requires mandatory
attendance: University and departmental policies tolerate 3 absences. It is
important to note that _there is no such thing as an **excused** absence;
there are only **allotted** absences_. If you suspect that you may be sick
later in the semester or that you may encounter some sort of unexpected
emergency, do not use up your _allotted_ absences frivolously. I do not want
to see doctor's notes, letters from parents, and so on. All absences will be
regarded the same. Following the allotted number of absences, your grade will
be lowered _automatically_ by a full level for each period missed (A to B, B
to C, etc.). For additional information refer to the Departmental Policy on
Student Absences. _Any student who misses five classes (which include the
three allotted absences) will not pass this course_.

_

Plagiarism_: See the UNCA policy. You must acknowledge any use of someone
else's words or ideas by using quotation marks and/or the appropriate
documentation. **If you plagiarize, you will fail this course automatically.**

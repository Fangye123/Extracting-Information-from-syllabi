    **Assignment due: third paper (6 pages).**
    Economic historians have long been fascinated with the question of why the  "west," after a late 
    start by most measures, moved ahead of its eastern rivals in the early modern period in the long
    race of economic development. In 1981 Eric Jones, in a book titled _The Economic Miracle_ , 
    argued that political culture made all the difference. He claimed that "Europe [in contrast
    to East and Central Asian empires] had avoided the "plunder machine" and that "European
    kings were never as absolute as they demographic regime, ie. it was not nearly so overpopulated
    as its eastern rivals. More recently the eminent Harvard historian David Landes has argued
    in his book _The Wealth and Poverty of Nations_ that  "if we learn anything from the history
    of economic development, it is that culture makes all the difference." (This comes at the end
    of a 500 page tour de force of world history.) Douglas North, one-time winner of the Nobel 
    prize in economics, has argued that the west had better institutions like an open market
    place and private property rights. Joel Mokyr and many others have posited the west's 
    ultimately superior technology (and science too). Recently, folks have been talking most about
    trade and in particular the merits of the "Atlantic Economy" including a recent paper coauthored
    by an MIT faculty member Daron Acemoglu titled "The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade,
    Institutional Change and Economic Growth."
    
    Chose at least one of these broad theories about the origins of the European
    success story and assess it in the context of the material we have read and talked about this
    semester. You need not attempt to answer fully the big question posed at the outset. Rather 
    just find a piece of the puzzle which can be tackled given the reading you have done and 
    reflect on the implications of the evidence you have seen so far. In particular, be thinking about
    the themes we have covered most recently, that is expansion of trade networks, the rise of 
    consumer culture, the insights provided by historical demography, and the politics of
    mercantilism.

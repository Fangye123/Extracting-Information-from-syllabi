my classes***

_COURSE DESCRIPTION_

Since 1939, when he first graced the cover of Action Comics, Superman has
become one of the most recognizable heroic symbols in America. While comic
books have traditionally been viewed as a children's genre, one with little or
no value to an educated reader, the stories told in them have become
increasingly complex and relevant. This class will focus on the American
Superhero comic book in an attempt to discover some of the issues surrounding
and within the genre. Among others, we will attempt to answer the question,
"Why are superheros so important to us and what do they say about America?"

This course will survey some of the most important and interesting characters
and stories in the world of the superhero comic book since Superman first
decided to fight for truth, justice and the American way. We will question the
ways good and evil are presented and represented, the way in which justice is
decided and upheld and the way that "truth, justice and the American way" is
defined, challenged and changed.

There is a wired component to the class. Because the scholarship pertaining to
comic books is sparse and scattered, we will use the Web as a tool to find,
collect, and create this material. Therefore, students will be required to
gain basic knowledge skills associated with the creation of a Website.

Most of all, this is a discussion class. Students are expected to do all of
the reading and to come to class prepared to discuss those readings. As part
of their discussion grade, students will be asked to sign up to lead
discussion two weeks in the semester. In leading discussion, students are
expected to provide discussion questions over the class reflector at least two
days before class.

A class reflector will be set up for administrative purposes. If students feel
the need to discuss class over the reflector, that's great, but it is not a
requirement.

_REQUIRED READINGS_

All books can be purchased at the campus bookstores, local comic book stores
or on the web. All readings with a * next to them will be included with a
course packet which can be purchased at the Maryland Book Exchange.

PLEASE NOTE: Comic Books have a large fan community that is very active on the
Internet. Most of the comic books, comic book superheroes, and comic book
writers and artists that we will be discussing have several Websites devoted
to them. Search these sites out! They might turn out to be invaluable
resources in understanding the comic book and in your research. Feel free to
recommend these sites to your classmates and to discuss them in class.

_ASSIGNMENTS_

WEBSITE  
Students are required to create a basic Website that will be connected with
the class Website. I will provide a session on html outside of class.
Information about what has to be on the site will be included on the
assignment sheet. Basic Website due Feb. 23rd. Students will be required to
update their Website throughout the semester.  
  
CREATING COMICS  
In _Understanding Comics_ , Scott McCloud gives a definition of what a comic
is. Using that definition, the student will create a short (9-15 panel) comic.
Students will learn to scan and add this to their Website. Due Feb. 23rd.  
  
CURRENT COMICS  
There are hundreds of superhero comic books currently in running titles. What
are the themes of the current comics? How do these comics add to our
scholarship? Students will be required to go to a comic book store the first
week of class and choose a title to follow for the semester (make sure you get
a monthly title so that you will be able to read at least three issues.) If
you are interested in a certain issue or theme, ask the people working in the
store; everyone who works in a comic book store seems to be very knowledgeable
about all of the titles the store carries. At the end of the semester,
students will be required to write a short (5-7page) paper about the title and
how it relates or adds to the themes of the class. Students will add this
paper to their Website. Due May 4th.  
  
COMIC SCHOLARSHIP  
Students will be required to produce a final project that addresses a central
theme, issue or idea of the class. The final project can take one of the two
following forms:  
Seminar Paper - If a student wishes they may produce the standard scholarly
paper.  
Web Paper - Students may expand upon their Website in order to discuss in
detail their topic. Students who choose this form are encouraged to create
their site in a way that effectively uses the technology. This means that you
should use hypertext and scans of comic panels in your paper.  
#NOTE: If a student has a different idea for a final project, submit a one
page proposal to me by Apr. 13th.

### Course Objectives

Database management systems form the backbone of virtually every modern
corporate information system. The database supports the organization's highly
structured, operational activities (e.g., inventory, sales, marketing,
personnel) as well as the ad hoc, strategic managerial analysis of complex
business decision problems (e.g., new product introduction, plant expansion,
downsizing, stock offerings). Without a well designed and intelligently
implemented database, the organization will have a difficult time remaining
competitive in the marketplace.

This course provides a balanced introduction to corporate database management
system design and implementation. We will examine effective strategies and
techniques for modeling typical corporate data collection, retrieval and
analysis problems. By understanding the information needs and data flows
within an organization, we can create a database solution that best serves our
users. The design skills we will master in this course are universal. That is,
the same basic modeling skills are needed whether we are designing a database
for a single-user, pc-based environment or for a thousand-user, client-server,
distributed environment.

Given a database design, and the corresponding hardware and network
environment, the next crucial step of the process is the implementation phase
(including verification). We will use Microsoft Access 2000 (with VBA) as our
primary vehicle for mastering the database implementation process. We will
also touch upon the use of ASP (with VBScript) for the implementation of web-
based databases.

Given a design and implementation, the final step of the process is the
ongoing monitoring and revision of the database management system as the
organization, the users and the database itself evolve. Clearly, this step
never ends.

### Prerequisite

The only formal prerequisite for this course is the successful completion of
MIS 310 or its equivalent.

### Recommended Textbook

_Running Microsoft Access 2000_  
John Viescas  
Microsoft Press, 1999

### Other Books

Although I believe the Viescas book is an excellent general resource for this
level of class, you may want to supplement it with other references. A quick
trip to any major bookstore will reveal that the list of available book titles
covers everything from _Access 2000 for the Braindead_ to _Mastering Every
Stinkin' Access/VBA Feature in 90 Days or Less_. If you decide to purchase a
supplementary book for this course, then make sure it is written for Access
2000. The CBA labs will not switch to Access 2002 until this summer.

### Grading

Homework & Quizzes | 30 percent  
---|---  
Project Design | 5 percent  
Project Presentation | 5 percent  
Project Implementation | 20 percent  
Midterm Exam | 15 percent  
Final Exam | 25 percent  
  
### Pass/Fail

MIS 325 cannot be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. The policy applies to everyone:
MIS majors and non-majors.

### Attendance

Roll will not be taken this semester, but attendance is strongly encouraged.
No credit will be given for pop quizzes or in-class assignments missed for
non-approved reasons.

I have two sections of the class. You can attend either set of lectures, but
you must take the midterm and final exams with your registered section.

### Assignments

All assignments will be posted on the web the same day they are announced in
class. Most assignments will be announced a week before they are due in order
to allow you to balance your workload.

Assignments will be collected at the beginning of class. Late assignments will
be penalized twenty percent per calendar day (not counting Saturday and
Sunday) up to the time when the graded assignments are returned. In order to
be fair to the other students in the class, late assignments cannot be
accepted after that.

### Re-grades

Occasionally an assignment or exam is misgraded. All requests for re-grades
must be submitted within one week of the date the graded item is returned to
the class.

### Project

One of the most valuable educational components of this course is the group
project. Although we will not formally begin the project until mid-semester,
you should be giving some consideration to your topic and team members.

### IF Account

You must have an active IF account for this class. You will need it for your
ASP assignment and the final exam.

### Lab Proctors

The [Millennium Lab](http://bevo2.bus.utexas.edu/labops/facilities.htm) is
staffed by (non-paid) upper division MIS majors. Their role is to help with
the technical aspects of MIS 325 and 333K assignments. Their schedule will be
published on the web.

### Students With Disabilities

The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.

### Topics And Readings

The following schedule provides the expected coverage dates for each of the
major topics in the course. As with most classes, you should attempt to read
all assigned material prior to the lecture, then review the readings and your
notes following the lecture. Frequent practice with Access and the sample
databases is also valuable.

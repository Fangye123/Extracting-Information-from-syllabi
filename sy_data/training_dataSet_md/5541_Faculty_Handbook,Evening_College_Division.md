This handbook outlines policies and procedures relevant to faculty of the
Evening College Division of the College of Evening and Continuing Education.
Please take time to read it carefully, and keep it for future reference.

contact your academic director, academic area coordinator, or the Evening
College Division staff. We will be happy to assist you in any way possible.  


**ABOUT THE EVENING COLLEGE DIVISION

* * *

** The Evening College Division is one of the largest urban evening colleges
in the country. We are proud of that fact, and equally proud of the breadth
and quality of our course offerings. A great deal of the credit for our
success belongs to our excellent faculty. We are pleased that you are a
member.

The Evening College Division offers programs leading to associate and
baccalaureate degrees, certificates and course opportunities in numerous
diverse fields of study. The College of Evening and Continuing Education
_Bulletin_ contains complete information about these programs. During recent
years, the Evening College Division has granted about 400 degrees (associate
and baccalaureate) annually. Approximately 4,500 students enroll each autumn
quarter; additional students enroll throughout the academic year.

The Evening College Division cannot offer full-time or tenured faculty
positions. All our faculty are considered part-time. Many of our faculty have
full-time teaching appointments in other colleges at UC. Most, though, are
drawn from the community at large. Our goal in hiring is for our faculty to
have at least a master's degree and increasingly we are enlarging our emphasis
on hiring terminal degrees.

The University of Cincinnati is accredited by the North Central Association of
Colleges and Secondary Schools, is a member of the National Commission on
Accrediting, and is recognized by the Ohio State Department of Education. It
also has professional accreditation in many specialized fields.

**THE COLLEGE MISSION**  
The College of Evening and Continuing Education provides a _gateway_ to the
educational resources of the University of Cincinnati for adults and other
nontraditional students.

  * _We **create** programs that meet when and where students need them _ including evenings and weekends, on-and off-campus in traditional and nontraditional formats.

  * We **offer** a variety of baccalaureate and associate degrees, as well as credit and noncredit programs, that respond to the traditional and contemporary needs and interests of our varied constituencies.

  * We **encourage** the university faculty, as well as the professional, business, and civic communities, to transform ideas and challenges into high quality lifelong education opportunities.

  * We **assi** st students in identifying and achieving educational goals by providing a full range of specialized support services and by serving as their advocate throughout the university.

  
We **value t** he personal fulfillment and professional development that come
from lifelong learning and the significant contributions of a diverse college
community.

**ACADEMIC COUNCIL**  
The academic council is composed of representatives elected by the faculty of
the Evening College Division. It has the authority to act for the faculty
between business meetings on all academic matters of the Evening College
Division. The dean of the college serves as chairperson of the council.

Serving the faculty as elected members of the academic council are: ****

**ACADEMIC AREA COORDINATORS**  
An academic area coordinator (AAC) serves as liaison between the college
administration and the faculty of his/her area. The AAC assists the academic
director in curriculum review and development, and in faculty recruitment and
orientation. Most AACs have full-time faculty appointments elsewhere at UC.

**FACULTY BENEFITS AND SERVICE

* * *

SICK LEAVE**  
An Evening College Division faculty member who is unable to attend to his/her
duties because of personal illness, injury, exposure to contagious disease
which could be communicated to others, or because of illness, injury or death
in his/her immediate family, may utilize accumulated sick leave to cover
absence from duty.

_Accrual_  
Time worked is based upon actual contact hours (with a contact hour
representing 50 minutes) rather than on credit hours. The Evening College
Division uses a base of 10 weeks per quarter.

State regulations provide that for part-time personnel, sick leave is accrued
at a rate of 4.6 hours for each 80 hours worked.

In contrast to a full-time faculty member, who accrues 1.25 days of sick leave
per month, a part-time faculty member in the Evening College Division teaching
a 3 credit hour course accrues 18 percent of the full-time amount, that is,
1.25 x .18, or .225 days per month. (In general, each credit hour taught is
credited as 6 percent of full-time.)

Total sick leave accrual for the academic year is the amount accrued during
the autumn, winter, spring and summer quarters. Sick leave is cumulative. The
sick leave policy became effective July 1 of 1977.

NOTE: Full-time faculty and unclassified employees of the university do not
accrue sick leave for supplemental or overload assignments, including teaching
in CECE.

_Use of Sick Leave_  
If the faculty member has sufficient accrued sick leave to cover the absence,
he/she will be paid in full. If not, his/her compensation for that quarter
will be reduced accordingly. Full-time employees who use accrued sick leave on
a given day will not be charged additional sick leave for an Evening College
Division class they are scheduled to teach that day. If accrued sick leave is
used for Evening College Division classes only, it will be charged at the rate
of1/2 day for each evening.

_Payment to Substitute_  
If the faculty member chooses to charge the absence due to illness against
accrued sick leave, the substitute must sign a University Contract verifying
remuneration and dates of service. Payment to the substitute will be made at a
rate of $35 per credit hour.

**MEDICARE**  
Federal legislation extends the hospital insurance portion of the FICA tax
(Medicare) to employees of state and local governments hired after 3/31/86.
The Medicare tax rate for employees is presently 1.45 percent of your monthly
income with an equal contribution by the university. Mandatory coverage for
newly hired UC employees is retroactive to April 1, 1986. Retirement
contributions and optional tax deferred annuities that provide shelters for
federal and Ohio income tax purposes are considered wages subject to FICA
taxes. Student employees of the university are ineligible for Medicare
coverage, and, consequently, are exempt fromthe tax.

Note: all employees of the State of Ohio continue to be exempt from Social
Security tax, the retirement segment of the FICA tax.

**RETIREMENT**  
Part-time faculty members participate in the State Teachers Retirement System
(STRS). Members=contributions (9.3% of the gross salary) will be deducted
automatically from lecturers' compensation. The university contributes 14.0%
of earnings. Members' contributions will be refunded upon written request if
their Ohio public service ends. Call benefits (513) 556-6381 for more
information.

_Student_ lecturers are exempted from the Public Employees Retirement System
(PERS) if they are enrolled and attending classes during the current academic
term at the state institution in which they are employed.

If you will no longer be teaching for the college, please notify the college
in writing.

**PHOTO I.D. BADGE**  
_To take advantage of most services and benefits you will need a UC Faculty
Photo I.D. Badge._  
(You will automatically receive a CECE Faculty I.D. card at the beginning of
the academic year, but you are urged to obtain and carry a UC Faculty Photo
I.D. Badge as well.)

For safety and security reasons,UC's Department of Public Safety strongly
recommends that faculty members obtain a UC Faculty Photo I.D. Badge. To
obtain one, please do the following:  


* Complete a UC Photo I.D. Badge Request card, obtained at the Faculty Support Desk.
* Take this completed card, along with a photo I.D. such as a driver's license, to the West Campus Key Control and I.D. Badge Office in the lobby of Four Edwards Center. (Call (513) 556-4946 for office hours.) Your UC Faculty Photo I.D. Badge will be prepared while you wait.
* * Note: Student lecturers will receive a CECE Faculty Identification Card, and they should obtain a UC Student Photo I.D. Badge, but they are not eligible for a UC _Faculty_ Photo I.D. Badge.

  
**PARKING**  
Evening College Division faculty with valid N-series decals can park on the
main campus drives , Zone AA,Zone AE and Stratford Lot. N-series decals are
valid from 4 p.m. to7 a.m. Monday-Friday, and all day on weekends with a cash
receipt purchased from the booth attendant. Faculty should enter at the Main
Gateon Clifton Avenue.

Faculty may also choose to purchase an evening lot decal per quarter. Daily
cash parking is available in all garage facilities. Cash parking for most
surface lots is available after 3 p.m. Please be aware that garage attendants
are on duty in garages until 10 p.m. Exiting after 10 p.m. requires payment to
a coin unit.

To obtain a decal, complete an application form at the Faculty Support Desk in
2510 French Hall. You will be notified when your decal is ready.

There is a fine for replacing any UC decal which is lost or stolen. We suggest
that you put your new decal in a holder on your dashboard, rather than on your
windshield, so you can move it from car to car as necessary. Please keep
Parking Services apprised of any vehicle or license changes.

Short-term parking to facilitate pick up and delivery of grade lists,
duplication orders, etc. is also available to Evening College Division
lecturers. By entering the University Avenue entrance and displaying an
N-series decal, you can receive a 15 minute pass to park in any white parking
stall.

**CLASS MANAGEMENT

* * *

CLASS SCHEDULING**  
The college must meet the challenge of scheduling courses each quarter and
coordinating days and times. When scheduling classes, the college attempts to
accommodate faculty and students. Although normal times of CECE classes are
from 6:30-9:10 p.m.; days and/or times are subject to change when scheduling
conflicts occur. Also, the college reserves the right to cancel classes when
appropriate.

**SYLLABUS**  
The course syllabus is an important guide for the instructor, the student and
the college. The outline below will help you prepare a comprehensive syllabus.
There are also several sample syllabi in the appendices. If you establish a
policy, be sure to state it clearly on the syllabus. You have the right to
establish such policies as long as they do not conflict with existing UC or
CECE policies.

_Note: You must submit a copy of your course syllabus to the Evening College
Division Office at the beginning of each quarter._

**CLASS ATTENDANCE**  
Regular class attendance and class participation are important determinants of
student success. Generally, the college expects each student to attend every
session of each course for which he/she is registered, and, if absent, to be
held accountable for work missed. However, each faculty member has the right
to establish and enforce attendance requirements for his/her course.

**OFFICIAL WITHDRAWAL - "W"**  
Students may drop a course during the first 21 calendar days of any quarter on
their own initiative. No instructors signature is required on the drop/add
form, and the course is deleted from the student=s academic record. From the
22nd through the 58th calendar day of the quarter, student may withdraw over
the signature of their instructor, who must assign a grade of AW or AF. (For
Evening College courses only, instructors do not always sign, and a A#
denoting a drop may be printed on the final grade roster which the instructor
may change to a AW or AF.)

After the 58th calendar day of the quarter, no course withdrawals will be
considered except where unusual circumstances exist. Exceptions alowing course
withdrawal after the 58th day require the signed approval of the Dean=s
representative in the student's home college in addition to the instructor's
signature and grade.

**UNOFFICIAL WITHDRAWAL - "UW"**  
When a student registered for undergraduate credit has never attended a class
or has stopped attending without explanation, the instructor has several
options. If the instructor assigns either a AUW or an AF, the student received
0 (zero) quality points in computing the grade point average. If the grading
box is left blank, no grade is recorded. For undergraduates, an AI has no
affect on the GPA for one quarter, but thereafter carries 0 (zero) quality
points.

**PRE/COREQUISITES**  
Students are expected to be aware of course pre/corequisites as they appear in
the college _Bulletin_. Please announce them at the first class meeting, and
include such information on your course syllabus.

Ordinarily, students who lack the pre/corequisites should not be allowed to
continue in the course and you are within your rights to ask them to withdraw.
If you choose to allow the student(s) to remain in the course, you should make
it clear to them that they have full responsibility for the consequences of
their decision. Do not modify the course or make special concessions to
accommodate the student(s).

**STUDENT DATA CARDS/SHEETS**  
Student Data Cards/Sheets are available at the Faculty Service Desk for
faculty who want a record of background information about their students.
Instructors usually ask their students to complete the cards during the first
class meeting. It is important to inform students that completing the cards is
voluntary.

Suggestion: For your convenience and the convenience of your students, you
might want to prepare a student telephone roster. Ask students to indicate on
the Student Data Card/Sheets whether they wish to be included. Type a list of
names and phone numbers of those who wish to be included. Have copies made and
distribute them to the class. Students are often pleased to have a way to
contact each other. If you want to disseminate information to students between
class sessions, you can start a telephone chain by calling the first student
on the roster.

**EVALUATION OF INSTRUCTION**  
The Evening College Division uses a questionnaire called the Student
Evaluation of Teaching. It is intended to help the college maintain its high
quality of instruction, and to provide an opportunity for the faculty member
to obtain feedback from students.

_Each faculty member is required to process evaluation forms for each regular
course taught._  
Evaluation packets will be placed in faculty mailboxes near the end of the
quarter. Please administer the evaluation as directed.  
Results of evaluations are made available to students, administrators and
faculty.

**FACULTY ABSENCES**  
Since most Evening College Division classes meet once a week, each session
represents a sizeable proportion of the instructional material, as well as a
significant financial investment for students. It is important for each
faculty member to make every effort to insure that class meets as scheduled.
If you are unable to attend class, contact your Academic Director immediately.
It it is after 5 p.m. call Faculty Service (513) 556-1139.  


**CURRICULUM

* * *

GENERAL EDUCATION**  
The General Education Program proposes a common set of requirements to be
shared by all degree programs at the University of Cincinnati. These
requirements expose students to the main areas of traditional knowledge, as
well as to current issues of our day. The courses are designed to teach
critical thinking and at least one communication skill oral, written or
visual. The General Education Program includes three sets of specific
requirements: a freshman English and mathematics requirement, a distribution
requirement and a capstone requirement.

The College of Evening and Continuing Education will begin a phased
implementation of General Education beginning Autumn Quarter, 98-1. All
incoming freshmen, and transfer student who are granted fewer than 90 credit
hours for prior college work, must fulfill 9 credits in English Composition, 9
credits I mathematics (any CECE math can be used except 104), a minimum of
four general education-approved courses across 3-4 distribution areas, and a
3-6 hour capstone experience.

Transfer students who are granted 90 hours or more of advanced standing will
be required to complete 9 credits in English Composition, 9 credits in
mathematics, a minimum of two general education-approved courses across 3
distribution areas, and a 3-6 hour capstone experience.

Each year, we will evaluate our situation and continue to add requirements
until we are in full compliance with the UC General Education initiative. When
in full compliance, each CECE baccalaureate degree student will complete 9
credit hours of English, 9 hours of mathematics, 33 credit hours across 8
distribution areas, and a 3-6 credit hour capstone experience. (See General
Education description for a definition/description of distribution areas.)

General Education-approved courses are identified in _Learning Opportunities_.
A complete listing of UC General Education-approved courses can be found on
the Internet at the following address: www.UC.edu/gened

_To have your course approved as a General Education course, you must submit a
detailed description of what you do (or, intend to do) in your course. A
rather extensive review takes place both at the college and university level.
Faculty are encouraged to develop/propose courses for approval as general
education courses. The college provides a small stipend as an incentive. If
interested, please speak with your academic director._

In the future, all CECE baccalaureate students will be required to take 11
General Education courses (33 hours), and a Capstone course (36 hours) in
addition to a full year of English and math. Those courses which are approved
as General Education courses will be in high demand by students. We expect
this demand to change the pattern of course selection by our students.  


**GRADING

* * *

CLASS LISTS**  
During the first few weeks of the quarter, preliminary class lists will be
placed in your mailbox. Each of these lists will indicate enrollment as of a
given date. It is wise to call the roll from these preliminary lists. If a
student's registration is in doubt, refer the student to the
Information/Registration Center.

During the fourth week of the quarter, an official class list will be placed
in your mailbox. By the time this list is generated, all registrations should
be completed. Any student who is not on the list must clarify the matter with
the Office of Student Records before returning to class. Do not admit to class
a student whose name is not on the official class list, unless he/she has
other proof of registration.

All class lists are for your use; they need not be returned to the Evening
College Division Office.

**GRADE LIST**  
During the week before final exams, you will receive a grade list. This is the
document on which you record and submit students' grades.

For students who withdrew after the third week, the symbol # will appear in
the grade column. You should assign a W (withdrawal passing) or an F
(withdrawal failing) for these students. Since the grade lists are printed one
week before the withdrawal period ends, some # notations may not appear. If
you assign a W grade to a student who did not withdraw officially, the grade
will be changed to UW by the Office of Student Records.

When you have completed the grade list, you must _sign_ at the bottom. Keep
the professor's copy for your records and take the remaining copies to the
Faculty Service Desk. _You must submit your completed grade list by noon on
Monday following exam week_. If a grade list is not submitted on time, each
student will receive no grade. (If No Grade Reported--Students Contact
Instructor). Similarly, any student whose grade is not recorded on the grade
list will receive no grade. The registrar leaves the record blank.

Note: On the Thursday following exam week, the Registrar's Office mails grade
reports to students. These grade reports are the university's only
communication to students regarding their grades.

Please mention to your students that Evening College Division policy prohibits
staff members from telling students what grades they have received.

**SYSTEM OF GRADING**  
As of 9/98 you will be able to use the +/- system of grading. (Please see
Appendix Q for Guidelines) This should make grading in many of our courses
much easier.

The I grade (incomplete)is given only under documented circumstances like
illness, over burdening job situations, etc. It is not administered if a
students is performing poorly and simply wishes to take the course again
without paying. To remove the incomplete, the student needs to fulfill
incomplete assignments decided upon by the instructor prior to issuance of the
I grade. A new form will include a section for statement of the reason for the
incomplete.

The grade of N no longer exists. An IP is issued to mean IN PROGRESS. Courses
for which this grade can be issued must be on file with the registrar. Please
check to make sure that any course for which you wish to issue this grade has
been approved to do so.

The grade of Y has been changed to UW, Unofficial Withdrawal. This grade is
used if a student has either never attended class or has disappeared without
officially withdrawing or has been approved for an I. If a W is on the grade
sheet and a student has not withdrawn officially, it will be changed by the
registrar to a UW.

REGRADING: If for some reason a faculty member cannot complete assignment of a
grade, the AD will identify faculty from this university to assist in
assigning a grade.

It is strongly suggested that no student be allowed to add a class after the
second week of class unless there are extenuating circumstances. In this event
the circumstances should be discussed with the academic director.

After 9/98, a faculty member can change a grade after one year. A grade change
is only issued for fulfilling an incomplete or correcting a clerical error.
After one year, the Academic Director must approve the grade change. No grade
changes can be made after four years. You should make this new policy clear to
your students.

_Grade_ _Description Quality Points_  
  A Excellent 4.00 | B Good 3.00 | C Satisfactory 2.00 | D+ 1.33 | I
Incomplete 0 | P In pass/fail | UW Unofficial Withdrawal None  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A- 3.67 | B- 2.67 | C- 1.67 | D Poor 1.00 | I/F Incomplete to Fail (1 yr) | T
Audit None | W Withdrawal (Official) None  
B+ 3.33 | C+ 2.33 |  | F Fail 0 | I/P In Progress | U Unsatisfactory | W
Withdrawal (Official) None  
  
If no grade is reported the registrar leaves the record blank.

**FINAL EXAMS**  
It is a violation of UC and CECE policy to schedule the final exam early and
skip the final class meeting.

**MAKE-UP EXAMS**  
The Evening College Division provides proctored make-up exam sessions on
several Saturday mornings each quarter. The dates of the sessions are listed
on the Lecture/Examination Schedule. The procedure for make-up exams is
outlined below.  


* The faculty member must bring the exams to the Faculty Service Desk by noon on Friday before the make-up exam session. The faculty member will be given an envelope for each exam for each student. He/she should fill in all the blanks on each envelope and insert the exam.
* Proctors will be available on Saturday mornings. Contact the Faculty Service Desk for exact times.
* Make-up exams will be administered by the college only on the scheduled dates. Any other arrangements must be made privately between instructor and student.
* On Monday following the make-up session, a note will be placed in the faculty member's mailbox, indicating that the exams are ready to be picked up.
* If a student fails to take the make-up exam within two sessions of the time it is delivered to Faculty Service Desk, the exam will be returned to the faculty member.
* When a student completes the requirements of the course, the instructor must submit a Change of Grade form (available at the Faculty Service Desk).
  
If no grade is reported the registrar leaves the record blank  


**SUPPORT SERVICES AND OFFICE PROCEDURES

* * *

FACULTY SUPPORT DESK**  
The Faculty Support Desk (513) 556-1139 is located in 2510 French Hall.
Faculty members use the desk to deliver and pick up materials and to make
inquiries. Forms of all types are available here.

**FACULTY RESOURCE ROOM**  
The college has set aside a room on the second floor of French Hall (Room

Faculty mailboxes are located on the walls of the Faculty Resource Room (2609
French Hall) and are assigned, in alphabetical order, to all faculty members
teaching in a given quarter. Your mail is inserted in the cubicle above your
name tag. _It is extremely important that you check your mailbox before your
class meets each week_. Practically every office-initiated communication
directed to faculty and students is placed in these mailboxes; thus, it is our
primary communication channel.

**COMLINE**  
This quarterly publication is the primary means the college uses to
communicate news, announcements and important dates to faculty and students.
_ComLine_ is mailed to   homes the second week of the quarter. You will also
receive a copy of the _ComLine_ in your mailbox. To place announcements in
either publication, contact Jeannette Bartley, (513) 556-9178.

**CLASSROOMS**  
The Scheduling Office will assign a room for your class based on the class
size and special needs of the course. If there are problems with your room,
please contact the Scheduling Office (513) 556-9183. In case of a room change,
a sign will be posted to direct the students to the new location.

Call the Faculty Support Desk if your class meets in a location other than the
regularly scheduled classroom, as when you have planned a field trip. This
will help us inform students who were not aware of the plan, and enable us to

**DUPLICATING**  
The Faculty Support Desk can arrange to have class materials typed and/or
duplicated.  


* Use the Duplication Order request form, available at the Faculty Support Desk. Please adhere to the duplication schedule printed on the form. Working days include Monday-Friday only. Orders received after 3 pm will be logged in the next day.
* Materials from clear 8.5x11 or 8.5x14 originals can be reproduced and/or typed. Stencils, offset masters and dittos cannot be used.
* Only materials pertaining to your Evening College Division class, such as syllabus, handouts and exams, can be duplicated.
* Material covered by copyright laws cannot be duplicated without permission from the publisher. The letter giving you permission to have the material duplicated must be attached to the duplication order.
* The beginning of the quarter, mid-term and final exam weeks are the busiest. Any additional time you can give will be appreciated.
* Ordinarily your completed order will be placed in your mailbox. In the case of large or confidential orders, however, a note will be placed in your mailbox directing you to the Faculty Support Desk.

  
**COMPUTER SCORED EXAMS**  
Many faculty members use exams which can be graded by computer. There is no
minimum class size requirement and provisions can be made for combining
objective tests with some combination of essay questions.

_Procedure_

* Prepare an answer key using a No. 2 pencil which will be used to set the computer with the correct answers. _Do not_ mark anything in the space for student name and ID number. Obtain the User Form and answer sheets at the Faculty Support Desk.
* Ask your students to bring two No. 2 pencils to the exam. This is the only kind of pencil which can be used on computer answer sheets.
* Complete the User Form as appropriate for your examination.
* Deliver your key, the User Form and the students' answer sheets to the Computer I/O Office located in the lower level of Beecher Hall (one floor below the level of the Cashier's Office). You can enter through the rear entrance to Beecher or from the bridge to Tangeman University Center.
* During the week of final exams, graded exams will not be delivered to the Faculty Support Desk Wednesday-Friday. On those days, you must pick up your graded exams at the Computer I/O Office.

  
_Output_  
You will receive a computer printout along with the key and answer sheets.
Please recognize that the program supplies a ranking _score_. It is your
responsibility to assign _grades_. On Side 2 of each answer sheet, the date
and the number of correct answers will be listed.

The computer printout will provide you with exam grades (scores) and an item
(question) analysis.

**LIBRARY RESERVE PROCEDURES**  
The Evening College Division is served primarily by the Langsam Library
(formerly Central Library), but several other UC libraries (e.g., Math, DAAP)
offer similar services. Faculty are required to present a UC Faculty Photo
I.D. Badge.

Following is a list of guidelines for the preparation and submission of
reserve requests at Langsam. If these guidelines are observed, the Library
will insure that the majority of reserve items requested will be available on
the first day of classes. Reserve requests are processed in the order
received.

_Request Forms._ Requests must be submitted on multi-copy request forms
supplied by the Circulation Desk.  
_Initial Submittal._ To allow for technical processing, recalls, searches,
etc., please submit reserve requests according to the following time
schedules:  


* For materials owned by the university libraries, allow three weeks before the beginning of class. For these materials, Library of Congress call numbers, as assigned by the University of Cincinnati Libraries, must be supplied.
* For materials which are not owned by the university libraries allow six to eight week before the beginning of classes.
* For out of print materials or materials which must be purchased from foreign countries allow at least eight weeks before classes begin.
__

  
_Loan Periods._ The instructor specifies the loan period on which he/she
wishes the reserve items to circulate. The following loans are offered:  


* Two Hour Loan. The material may be used for two hour periods, in the library only.
* Overnight Loan. The material may be used for two hours in the library during the day. It may also be charged out for overnight use, beginning three hours before the library closes. It must be returned to the circulation desk the following day, three hours after the library opens.
* One Day Loan. The material may be charged out anytime for one day. It must be returned to the circulation desk the following day, three hours after the library opens.
* Three Day Loan. The material may be charged out anytime for three days. It must be returned to the circulation desk on the fourth

NOTE: All reserve items are held in the closed reserve area to provide maximum
security. Library personnel will do their best to protect items on reserve,
but the library cannot be held responsible for damaged or lost items. I

###  Course Requirements:

  * Complete all assignments listed below and others given in class.
  * Read and be prepared to discuss extra handouts as given in class.
  * Be prepared for and actively participate in all class activities.
  * Review at least 20 articles and books on teaching mathematics, at least one before each class meeting, and post your review on the web. Some of these reviews will be on topics of your choosing. Others will be on topics announced in class.
  * Report on a web search for resources on mathematics education.
  * Attend the Minnesota Council of Teachers of Mathematics Conference in Duluth on March 22-23 or complete alternate professional development assignment.
  * Keep a journal of reflections and reactions to readings and class discussions,responses to questions posed in class, and solutions to problems. **This is your reflective journal. You should write in it no less often than following every class period.** Journals should be either hand-written or typed. They should be submitted in their entirety each time journals are collected (approximately four times during the semester).
  * Prepare and present 3 microteaching lessons, at least one using computer or calculator technology. Each series of micro lessons will have specific topic requirements.
  * Observe and critique all microteaching lessons.
  * Prepare two teaching units: one from a sequential text and one from an integrated text. Each should be a problem-based teaching plan for a two or three week unit in high school mathematics. At least one plan should be on a topic that you will teach during student teaching, and ideally, both will be on the same topic..
  * Prepare a resource file that you will use when you are teaching your unit plans.
  * Complete an alternative assessment project in which you will complete two assessment tasks and evaluate tasks completed by other students..
  * Prepare a portfolio documenting your attainment of BOT requirements in mathematics.
  * Complete a take-home final

###  Grading

Component | Criteria | Percent of Grade  
---|---|---  
Class participation | Present, on time and prepared for every class activity,
including microteaching. Has done assigned reading and other preparation and
participates actively in discussions and activities. | 15%  
Micro Teaching | Evidence of careful and thorough preparation, both in content
and in presentation. Attention to established principles of lesson planning,
to standards for school mathematics, and to modifications needed for class
circumstances. Evidence that the plan is different from plans presented in
Education 330. | 10%  
Readings and Web Search  | Evidence of both wide and deep reading and thinking
about issues and ideas in journals. Timeliness in reporting on readings and
care in writing and posting reviews (including correct grammar, spelling, and
web form).  | 20%  
Teaching plans and resource file | Attention to NCTM standards and principles
for high school mathematics. Fit with possible student teaching assignment.
Evidence of careful attention to principles of unit planning, including
motivation, development, assessment.  | 15%  
Portfolio of mathematics learning | Attention to principles of compiling and
presenting portfolios. Evidence of care and thoughtfulness of selection of and
reflection on artifacts presented. | 5-10%  
Journal | Evidence of timely, regular and thoughtful reflection on class work
and experiences. Attention to each journal assignment made by the instructor
as well as unstructured entries.  | 10%  
Final exam | Evidence of strong understanding of topics covered in class as
well as ability to find new information or think about new ideas.  | 15%

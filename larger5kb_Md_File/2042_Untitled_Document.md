**SYLLABUS**

  

**Course Description** :

This course is an introduction to the politics and institutions of American
Government and the behavior of its citizenry. Students will be introduced to
the philosophies that underpin the United States system of government and how
these philosophies reveal themselves in the structure of government, citizen
participation, and current political debates. We begin the semester with an
examination of the Constitution: its history, its institutional arrangements
and the individual rights articulated in the Bill of Rights and other
amendments. The second major section focuses on the formal institutions of
American government: the presidency, Congress, the judiciary, and the
bureaucracy. In our examination of each of these institutions, we will
consider the powers available to each and also the interaction between the
branches. Finally, we will look at how citizens interact with government and
express their political preferences through the study of public opinion,
political parties, the media, campaigns, elections, voting and interest
groups. Throughout the semester, we will consider current issues in American
politics and how they relate to the assigned readings. In addition, the class
will also introduce students to the study of political science as an academic
discipline.

The class meets for lecture twice a week, and for smaller discussion groups
once a week. You are encouraged to attend both lectures and discussion
meetings, and to have read the assigned reading material for each meeting. At
the discussion meetings, you are expected to be able to discuss the weeks
readings and apply them to current issues in American politics. Following
current political events will enable you to more thoughtfully contribute to
class discussions. On occasion, you will be given assignments to complete for
the discussion sections.

  
  

**Course Requirements:**

There will be three exams: two midterms and one final exam. Each will comprise
25% of your final grade. The exams will not be cumulative. In addition, you
will be expected to attend and actively participate in your assigned
discussion section. This will comprise the final 25% of your grade.

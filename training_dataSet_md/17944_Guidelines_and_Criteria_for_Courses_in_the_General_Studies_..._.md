**_Guidelines and Criteria for Courses in the General Studies_**
******_Curriculum_**

Courses in the General Studies Curriculum are elements of an integrated
system. Some courses provide essential skills in the communication of thought
or in the manipulation of quantitative data while others develop aesthetic
appreciation. Still others impart a knowledge of history, language,
literature, and the natural and social worlds. The General Studies Curriculum
is designed to provide a foundation both for further study and for personal
enrichment.

The basis for the General Studies Curriculum is Act No. 94-202:

    To amend Section 16-5-8, Code of alabama 1975, to provide for a uniform articulation agreement among all instutions of higher education and a statewide general studies curriculum; to provide for the computation of grade point averages of certain transferred students; (pp. 257-58)

Key provisions of this act include:

> This committee (articulation and general studies committee), utilizing
whatever resources and task forces it deems appropriate, shall develop no
later than September 1, 1998, a statewide freshman and sophomore level general
studies curriculum to be taken at all colleges and universities. Nothing
herein shall be interpreted as restricting any institution from requiring
additional general studies courses beyond the statewide general studies
curriculum.

> This committee shall also develop and adopt no later than September 1, 1999,
for the freshman and sophomore years, a statewide articulation agreement for
the transfer of credit among all public institutions of higher education.
Under this articulation agreement, all applicable credits transferred from a
two-year institution to a four-year instituion shall fulfill degree
requirements at the four-year institution as if they were earned at the four-
year institution. The committee shall further examine the need for a uniform
course numbering system, course titles, and descriptions. (p. 260)

Interpretation (i.e., what the General Studies and Articulation Committee
expects)

> All colleges and universities must offer the general studies curriculum
mandated by the committee.

>

> All colleges and universities must submit courses to the committee for
inclusion in the general studies curriculum.

>

> The general studies curriculum consists of 60 semester hours of
transferrable credit.

**General guidelines and criteria** for courses in the General Studies
Curriculum are:

  1. Courses must be collegiate-credit courses at the freshman or sophomore level (i.e., 100 or 200 level);
  2. Courses must be broad in scope, present major intellectual or aesthetic ideas, and not be specialized or vocational in purpose;
  3. Courses must present the essential characteristics and basic processes of inquiry and analysis in the discipline;
  4. Courses must encourage the development of critical thinking skills and require students to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate knowledge;
  5. Courses must consider the subject in its relation to other disciplines and its application to human concerns.

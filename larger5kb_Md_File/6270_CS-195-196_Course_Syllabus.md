#### Purpose:

This is a two-semester course in which each of you will research, design,
implement, complete, document, and compare a project in hardware and/or
software.  
In the first semester you will:

  1. Select a project and have it approved by the Professor
  2. Perform a market analysis of your product
  3. Develop a project plan and time-line for the design and construction of the project.
  4. Design the project and present
    1. The preliminary design review
    2. The critical design review
    3. The final design review
  5. Start the construction of the project and give a progress review.

You will make formal oral presentations of the preliminary, critical and final
reports and the progress report.

If you need ideas for your project, [Here](ideas.html) is a partial list.

In the second semester you will:

  1. Continue to construct the project that was started in the first semester.
  2. Present four progress reviews of the state of the project. One review will be held approximately every 4 weeks.
  3. At each review you will present a slide presentation, demonstrate part of the project, submit your laboratory workbook for review and submit a written report.
  4. At the Final Project Review you will submit a complete report, demonstrate a working project, submit your laboratory workbook and present your completed project in a slide presentation.

You will make formal oral presentations of four progress reports and a final
presentation.

The Senior Computer Science Design Project gives the student a significant
design experience. The project, the student selects, should be in an area
which is of interest to the student. This is your project. You are to obtain
and pay for your own parts and components, including software. The University
will not supply parts or obtain them for you.

A significant part of this course is to learn to make written and oral
presentations of technical material. The student must attend all of the class
sessions in order to learn from each other, by example, what are the correct
and incorrect methods to present material. In addition to learning by example,
the student will gain knowledge from the instructor about techniques for
making good presentations. The grade you achieve in this course will depend
not only on producing a working product, but also on the manner in which you
present your work.

#### Prerequisites:

To take CS-195, you must have senior status and satisfy the following specific
prerequisites:

  1. CS-144/169 - Software Paradigms
  2. CS-152/151 - File Structures / Algorithms & Data Structures II
  3. CS-172/136 - Design of Computers / Computer Architecture II
  4. CS-156 - Introduction to Operating Systems
  5. CS-175/161 - Software Engineering II

To take CS-196, you must have senior status and have satisfactorily completed
CS-195.

#### Attendance:

Attendance is required at every session of the course. There will be lectures
and material presented even if no work product is due from the student.
Absence from class will reduce your grade. Three unexcused absences during the
semester will result in an automatic failure. Arriving late for a class is not
permitted. A late arrival is more than 15 minutes after the start of class.
Any combination of four unexcused absences and late arrivals is an automatic
failure.

#### Timely Presentations:

Each work product is due on the date shown on the schedule. Work products must
be presented on time showing the status of the project as of the time of
presentation. Late presentations of a work product will reduce the grade for
the product. Each week, or part of a week, that a work product is late will
reduce the grade by 10%. No work product will be accepted after students in
the class have started to present its successor product.

#### Notebook:

All the work you do and all the information you collect will be kept in a
formal bound laboratory notebook. All entries must be in ink and every page
must be dated and initialed. Since an economic analysis of your project must
be performed, you must keep a record of the amount of time you spend in each
phase of the project and the class of work you are doing. This information
will be kept on each page of the notebook. The notebook will be inspected and
graded periodically. Do not work on scratch paper. Do all of your work in the
notebook. You may cross out work that is incorrect. The notebook will not be
graded on beauty, only on completeness.

#### Attention in Class:

Every student is to give full time and attention to the student making the
oral presentation. No one is to be using the computers in the room for any
purpose. No printing of any material may be done once the class has begun. You
wish to have your fellow students listen to your presentation and you should
do the same for them.

#### Grading:

Grading for the first semester will be as follows:  
Product | Presentation | Demo | Report | Notebook | Total  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Proposal | 3 |  
| 6 | 1 | 10  
PDR | 6 |  
| 6 | 2 | 14  
CDR | 6 |  
| 10 | 2 | 18  
FDR | 11 |  
| 18 | 4 | 33  
PR #1 | 8 | 5 | 10 | 2 | 25  
TOTALS | 34 | 5 | 50 | 11 | 100  
  
Grading for the second semester will be as follows:  
Product | Presentation | Demo | Report | Notebook | Total  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
PR #2 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 2 | 12  
PR #3 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 2 | 12  
PR #4 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 2 | 12  
PR #5 | 6 | 5 | 7 | 2 | 20  
Final Project Pres. | 12 | 8 | 20 | 4 | 44  
TOTALS | 27 | 19 | 42 | 12 | 100  
  
Grading will be done on a maximum of 10 points for each work product. Not
submitting a work product on the date it is due will reduce the grade for that
product by one full point from its graded value for each week, or part
thereof, the product is late.

#### Deliverables:

During the academic year, you will make ten presentations of the progress you
are making on your project. These presentations will consist of 1) an oral
report using slides of status of your work, 2) a formal written report of the
status, 3) a demonstration of the completed work on the project, and 4) a
review of your notebook showing the details of your work. A paper copy of your
slides will be given to the professor at the time of the oral presentation.
They will be retained to show the accrediting team.

#### Class Conduct:

This course is intended for serious students. Participants will be expected to
adhere to all rules of professional behavior. As such, students are expected
to discuss their work with each other, but are also expected to do the work by
themselves. Any breach of professional ethics as evidenced, for example, by
copying exams or assignments, cooperating in more than discussions and study
groups, misusing computer resources, or using outside help of any kind, will
be considered adequate reason for failure in the course. It is to be
emphasized that knowledge of material and professional behavior are tied
together; failure in one of them negates any excellence in the other. Students
who stay in the course past the first two weeks agree to adhere to the
strictest rules of professional behavior.

The official statement for Academic Integrity can be accessed
[HERE](http://www.cs.gwu.edu/general/integrity.html). Those who have any doubt
about what that means, and fail to gain that understanding after a discussion
with the instructor, are encouraged to drop this class. Remember this warning
- any breach of ethics will fail you.

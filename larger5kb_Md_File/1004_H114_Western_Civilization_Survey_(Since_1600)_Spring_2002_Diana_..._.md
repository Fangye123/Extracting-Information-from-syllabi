**Reminder: the first paper is due on Feb.25 (a change from Feb.18).**  
  
**Purpose of Course**  
  
This course covers major political, social, and economic trends and events in
Europe from 1600 to around World War II. It seeks to examine the context and
causes for these trends and events through looking into modern day
explanations in the text and original writings of people who were participants
in these trends and events in the source book. This course also tries to trace
our ways of thinking to historical trends and events in Europe in the past
five hundred years, from our ideas of democracy, liberalism, nationalism,
authoritarianism, to our ideas of science and knowledge, among others.  
  
This course aims to fulfill the following goals of general education at
Indiana University Northwest (available in the IUN Bulletin 2000-2002, p.20):  
  
Goal 2: Students will think critically.  
Goal 5 Students will understand the value of the past and recognize the
relationship of the past to the present and to the future.  
  
 **What to expect**  
  
This course emphasizes a close reading of our textbook and document book.
Since one of the goals of this class is to fine tune critical reading skills,
a close reading of the text-a practice variously called textual analysis and
hermeneutics, among others, helps greatly toward that goal. You can see the
difference in one semester. Each class session consists of lecturing and
discussions. Each week there is a group discussion on an assigned questions.
So always be prepared when you come to class.  
  
If your textbook is new, it comes with a CD that has various quizzes on each
chapter. Do them when you can. It will help toward your in-class examinations.
See explanations of the examination under Class Requirements. The CD also has
a personality test-it enables you to know what kind of a learner you are. I
strongly encourage you to do this test if you have not done anything similar
before.  
  
Your textbook by Sherman also has an online source of support:
[www.mhhe.com/sherman](http://www.mhhe.com/sherman). There is a student center
there where you will find chapter outlines, summaries, review questions,
critical thinking questions, and lots more helpful things to assist you in
your reading of the textbook.  
  
Since I am dealing with grown-ups, I do not want to act like a high school
teacher or a boss. I award effort and excellence. I do not grade the class by
a curve, which means I do not give As and Bs by percentage, but award them to
individuals who truly deserve them.  
  
  
 **Course Requirements**  
  
There will be two in-class and two take-home examinations. The two in-class
examinations are based on short answer questions. The two take-homes are essay
questions with topics and due dates given in this syllabus. They are to be 4-6
pages long, typed, double-spaced, and with citations. They are based on the
specified readings. In addition, there will be a monthly quiz  
  
The grade distribution of each class requirement is as follows:  
  
The first in-class and take-home examinations: 15 per cent each.  
The second in-class and take-home examinations: 20 per cent each.  
Monthly quizzes: 5 per cent each.  
Class attendance and participation (including class and group discussions): 10
per cent.

was overthrow a king and replace him with his equivalent, though this
replacement took the title 'Lord Protector' instead of king, and ultimately
the monarchy itself was restored." "It was a big deal," another retorted. "It

**Class time and place:** The class meets Tuesday - Friday in Memorial 103
from 2:30 to 5:20. Part of the class time will be used as a lab in Memorial
102.

**Text:** Grauer  & Barber, Exploring Microsoft EXCEL (particularly chapters 1
to 4). We will also have some handouts including statistics, probability,
normal distributions and expected value.

**Freshman Experience January-Term University Requirements:** The Freshman
experience booklet states

> "These GUR courses will emphasize the skills of **_literacy**_ and
**_thinking**_ and **_community**_. They'll help provide a bridge for you in
applying your writing, speaking, and thinking skills ..."

Because this course satisfies the mathematical reasoning requirement, we will
emphasize literacy by learning to read and understand quantitative material.
We will emphasize thinking by learning problem solving using quantitative
mathematical analysis. We will emphasize community by working on some group
projects and by sharing the results of your projects with your group or the
whole class.

**Course goals:** We will learn how the computer (particularly a spreadsheet)
can be combined with mathematical reasoning to solve problems. We will learn
to use the spreadsheet program EXCEL from Microsoft. The emphasis will be on
problem solving and how spreadsheets can be used in this process. Problems
will come from business, financial transactions, education, probability,
statistics, and other areas where mathematics and data are used in everyday
life. We will also learn things about computers, the Windows operating system,
the Internet, etc. We will spend about 2 days learning to use internet tools
and creating a WEB home page.

**Lab Exercises:** To help you learn the material, we will have almost daily
labs. There will be about 11 or 12 different lab exercises. We will use the
IBM-compatibles in Memorial 102 for formal lab periods during class. You will
use the U.C. open lab to complete your computer assignments outside of class.
If you have other access to EXCEL, you may use it to complete your work but
your files must be made compatible with ours. Part of our exams and a little
of the lab work will require you to use equipment in the Memorial Lab. Lab
exercises are due at the beginning of class on the due date.

**Exams:** We will have two exams ( **Thur., Jan. 13 (Chapters 1-3)** and
(tentatively) Fri., Jan. 21 and a final exam (Fri., Jan. 28). These exams will
be in two parts: a traditional exam in the classroom and second part in
Memorial 102 where you can use the computer to help answer questions.

**Quizzes:** We will have about 6 short quizzes (sometimes unannounced) to
help you assess your progress.

**Class participation:** Students will frequently be asked to work in groups
during class. Sometimes the group will analyze and solve problems in class.
Sometimes you will be asked to explain your solution to an individual
assignment to your group. Sometimes groups will explain their group solution
to the class. Hence class attendance and participation is expected.

**Group Project:** Students will be asked to analyze a news article or
advertisement that includes quantitative data. (For example, a new car
advertisement might state that buyers can get 1.9% financing or $1000 cash
back. What would be the best option under some particular set of
circomstances?) The group will create a spreadsheet that quantitatively
analyzes the data and presents the anlysis in a manner that allow others to
understand and use the result. The group project proposal is due Tuesday, Jan.
11 and the group project is due Wednesday, Jan. 19. The group will present the
project to the class on Wednesday, Jan. 19 or Thursday, Jan. 20.

**Individual Project:** You will complete an individual project for this class
which is due on Wednesday, Jan. 26. You will give a short 5 minute
presentation about your project on Wednesday or Thursday of the last week of
class. The project should be designed to demonstrate your ability in
mathematical problem solving and use of a spreadsheet. The project may be
something that you have always wanted to do to save time and energy ("I wish I
had a ..."). It might involve a mathematical analysis for another class or for
your job. Some of the advanced problems in the text might give you an idea. A
written project proposal is due by Fri., Jan. 14 but you are encouraged to
discuss prospective topics with your instructor prior to that date.

**Grading:** Grades for the course will be computed approximately as follows:  

    
    
                      Lab and Homework Assignments   240
                      Group project                   50
                      Individual project              60
                      Quizzes (6 @ 20, best 5)       100
                      Two Exams  (2 @ 100)           200
                      Final Exam                     150
                      Class participation,
                          in class work              100
                                                     --- 
                      Total                          900
    

**Reminder:** This is a four credit course. You will be expected to spend
about 40 hours a week (including class time) on the course. Please plan your
schedule accordingly. It is important that you keep up and hand in your work
on time.

**Academic honesty:** Students are encouraged to get and provide help when
needed. However, unless otherwise stated in lab and homework assignments, the
work you turn in is expected to be primarily your own. Group projects are
acceptable only when the assignments specifies them. Consider writing a paper
for an English or History class. The instructor would normally be pleased if
you had someone proof read your paper or you visited the Writing Center.
However, if two students turned in the same paper, it would be considered
academic dishonesty. The same is true in this class. When you get help, you
**_must_** "footnote" that assistance.

**Floppy disks:** You will need to have at least four 3.5 inch high density
disks for storing your lab exercises and other work. A few assignments will be
turned in on a floppy. You can buy them at the bookstore or elsewhere. If you
buy them at the bookstore, remember to pick up stick-on a label for each disk.

**On-line materials:** Many of the class materials and examples will be
available from the class's WEB page `[
http://www.cs.plu.edu/courses/csce115/j00/home.html](http://www.cs.plu.edu/courses/csce115/j99/home.html)`  
Some of the materials are also available using anonymous FTP to
**ftp.cs.plu.edu** in the directory **pub/faculty/csce115**. While in Memorial
102, you can obtain the same material using a network drive setup in Microsoft
NT Explorer. The material is on the network drive **\\\sun0\ftphome** in the
subdirectory **pub\faculty\csce115.**

Students are required to have an account on PLU's computer "Sage" and are
strongly encouraged to check their e-mail regularly. Students will create a
home page on Sage. If students have concerns about personal privacy and the
use of Sage, they should consult the instructor.

**Attendance:** Regular attendance is expected. It is your responsibility to
get your work handed in on time, even when you have a legitimate excuse for
missing class. The instructor does not assume any responsibility for homework
turned in at any time except at the beginning of class on the due date. In
general, there will not be make-ups on quizzes and make-ups (for legitimate
reasons) on exams should be arranged ahead of time. Late homework and lab
exercises will be discounted at 25% per weekday. Assignments are due at the
_**beginning**_ of class. If you must miss class you should make arrangements
with someone in the class to turn in your homework and get notes and handouts
for you. We will be covering material in class that is not in the text.

**In case of difficulties:** PLEASE COME TO TALK TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF
YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE COURSE!

**Important dates:** Last date to drop without the instructor's signiture:
Jan. 10. Last date to drop: Jan 14. **Special note to students with
disabilities of any kind:** If you need course adaptations because of any sort
of disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with me, or
if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated,
please see me during my office hours as soon as possible.

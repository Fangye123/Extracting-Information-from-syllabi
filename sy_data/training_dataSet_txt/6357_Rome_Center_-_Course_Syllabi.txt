Course Syllabi


  All courses carry
three semester hours' credit. The University reserves the right
to
cancel a
course due to insufficient enrollment or the unavailability of a
suitable
professor. Students should bear in mind that 300-level courses  
presume prior contextual background or understanding, so they should
not register for courses for which they may be
unprepared.

 An Introduction to Greek Art  
FALL 
Prof. Giovanni Scichilone 
 Objectives
This course synthetically discusses the origins and the evolution of Greek Art against a relatively 
broad background with reference to the surviving evidence - literary and archaeological.  Special 
attention is given to the connections established by the Greeks with their Mediterranean neighbours 
across time and space as well as to the complex processes leading to the "formation" of a Greek Art.
Reference will also be made to the impact of Greek art and culture over later cultures of our world. 
The course aims to stimulate critical ability, visual sensitivity and an interest for considering the  
visual arts as a primary "tool" in the process of reconstructing and understanding cultures of the past. 

 Methodology
Every lesson will be richly illustrated by original slides from the instructor's collection; some of 
them will include readings from ancient written sources in translation.  In all cases class discussion 
and active participation in classwork are to be considered crucial and are highly valued and encouraged 
by the instructor.  Moreover, since the wealth of points and comparisons discussed in class can only in 
part find a substitute in the required readings for the course, class attendance is strongly 
recommended. 
After the first mid-term, the students will choose, under the instructor's guidance, the topic for an 
individual project in writing (a brief essay or a book report for the equivalent of 4-to-6 typed pages) 
ideally reflecting a personal interest within the scope of the course.

 An Introduction to Etruscan and Roman Art  
SPRING 
Prof. Giovanni Scichilone 
 Objectives
This course synthetically discusses both of the most relevant cultures flourishing in the Italian 
peninsula in ancient times, seeing art and its trends against the background of contemporary 
history. Due to the relative lack of adequate written sources, the Etruscans will be largely 
discussed on the basis of the abundant archaeological evidence and through the effects of their 
interaction with Mediterranean and Italian neighbours.  Though briefly, there will also be mentioned the 
complex problems related with their origins and with the interpretation of their "lost" language. 
The Etruscan impact over early Rome, the rise of the Roman republic and its growth into a world-wide 
empire will be discussed against the rich background supplied from sources of all sorts.  On the other 
hand, the impact of Greek culture over Rome as well as the rise of a genuinely Roman artistic tradition 
will be referred to from different viewpoints.  
The course tries to stimulate critical ability, visual sensitivity and an interest for considering art
in its historical context, as an essential "clue" to reconstruct and understand the cultures of the 
past.

 Methodology
Every lesson will be richly illustrated by original slides from the instructor's collection.
In all cases class discussion
and active participation in classwork are strongly encouraged.  Since the wealth of materials 
discussed in class can only in
part find a substitute in the required readings, class attendance is strongly
recommended. 
After the first mid-term, each student will choose, under the instructor's guidance, the topic for an   
individual project in writing  
ideally reflecting a personal interest within the scope of the course; such projects - in the format of 
a brief essay or book report for the equivalent of 4 to 6 typed pages - are to be completed two weeks 
prior to the end of the semester.

 An Introduction to Classical Archaeology  
FALL 
Prof. Giovanni Scichilone 
 Objectives
With special attention to the cultures of the Ancient Mediterranean, the course is meant to offer a 
fuller appreciation of modern archaeology with its scientific methodologies for the recovery, the 
interpretation and the presentation of the surviving evidence.  Well beyond "mass-myth" and 
misconceptions, the course discusses fieldwork, finds, sites and museums - as we see them today - as 
"tools" for research and knowledge and in connection with the very complex problems met in the 
conservation of the evidence.  The course also relates archaeology to several sciences and to modern 
education, trying to highlight the relevant reciprocal connections and/or contributions. 
To reflect also the long-lived interest shown by human groups for their own (and at times for other 
people's) past, the second part of the course (Lessons 9 to 12) will offer an overview of the changing 
approach of different societies to the past; this will be seen in ancient Greece and Rome, in specific 
moments of the European Middle Ages and of the Italian Renaissance, and in the following centuries up to 
the 1800's.  In this part of the course, students will have a chance to consider little-known aspects in 
the evolution of our interest for the relics and some "values" of our heritage. Moreover, as a 
fragment of the history of science, the growth of archaeology as a discipline will be synthetically 
followed. 
 Methodology  
To present with adequate clarity the material, each lesson will be richly illustrated by original slides 
from the instructor's collection as a visual stimulus for discussion in class.  Taking into 
consideration the complex scope of the course, active participation in classwork is to be considered 
crucial and will be highly encouraged and valued by the instructor.  Moreover, since no reasonably-sized
printed source is available in English to cover the range of topics under discussion, the students are 
expected to rely on adequate class notes; the instructor will be obviously available to discuss and 
enrich such notes whenever necessary.  On specific topics (marked "+&+" in the syllabus), abstracts 
in English from printed sources will be made available by the instructor.  For a variety of reasons, not 
the least of which is the length of classes, the instructor strongly recommends class attendance.  
After the first mid-term, the students will choose, under the instructor's guidance, the topic for an
individual project in writing (a brief essay or a book report for the equivalent of 4-to-6 typed pages) 
ideally reflecting a personal interest within the scope of the course.

 Classical Archaeology: The Idea of the Temple in Greek Architecture  
SPRING 
Prof. Giovanni Scichilone 
 Objectives
The course aims to relate the architectural type of "temple" to more than its visible form, with 
reference to various sources -- historical, literary, and archaeological.  Through space and time, the 
course reviews the birth of cult-places in the Greek lands, far before the creation of the earliest 
known temples.  While following the growth of an entirely Greek idea of temple, special attention is 
given to the interaction of Greek communities with their Mediterranean neighbours and both ritual and 
social functions of cult-places are explored. 
Insofar as design and styles are concerned, they are discussed side-by-side with the 
limitations and the achievements of ancient technology and engineering in Greece and beyond.  The 
appreciation of the exceptional creations of Greek temple-architecture, especially in the 5th century 
B.C., will therefore benefit by an analysis going beyond purely stylistic aspects. 
In general, the course tries to stimulate critical ability, visual sensitivity, and an interest for 
appreciating architecture in its historical and technological context, with attention for its functional 
roots.
Methodology 
The architectural evidence is reviewed through passages from the last available edition of the standard 
handbook of the late Prof. W.B. Dinsmoor (The Architecture of Ancient Greece, New York, 1975) to 
be used along with readings from other sources and notes from classwork. 
In all cases class discussion and participation in classwork are strongly encouraged. All lectures
will be richly illustrated by original slides from the instructor's collection.
Since the wealth of materials discussed in class can only in
part find an equivalent in the required readings, class attendance is highly
recommended.   
After the first mid-term, each student will choose, with the instructor's guidance, the topic for an
individual project in writing,
ideally reflecting a personal interest within the scope of the course; such projects - in the format of
a brief essay or book report for the equivalent of 4 to 6 typed pages - are to be completed two weeks 
prior to the end of the semester.

 Topography of Ancient Rome  
On-Site 
FALL & SPRING 
Prof. James G. DeVoto 
 Required Texts: 
 A. Macadam, Blue Guide: Rome, 7th ed. (London, 2001)
 A. Claridge, Rome: Oxford Archaeological Guide (Oxford, 1998)  
 Purpose:  
The aim of the course is to acquaint students with ancient remains and with some of the principal 
archaeological museums of one of the western world's greatest cities. 
 Procedure:  
The course will proceed chiefly through lectures on site.  The only exceptions will be the first meeting 
and the dates of the three examinations, all in classroom GL1.  Since the course involves  inspection 
of physical evidence  as well as reading assignments, attendance is crucial.  Students should note 
that travel is not an excuse for absence either from lectures or from the three 
examinations. 
 Grading:  
Three equally-weighted non-comprehensive examinations will determine the final grade.  For each test, 
students must be prepared to identify slides, words or phrases and to write two essays from a choice of 
three or four topics.  Essays will constitute 60% and identifications 40% of the grade on each test.  
The scale will be as follows: 90 to 100 = A, 80 to 89 = B, etc. 
 Office Hours:  
Room 116 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1200 to 1300 hours and by appointment.

Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, F. Coarelli's Guida Archeologica di Roma, and an 
illustrated guide to Ostia on reserve to help students prepare for each visit and the three tests.  In 
addition, entries in reference works such as the Oxford Classical Dictionary, The Princeton 
Encyclopedia of Classical Sites, or Grant and Kitzinger's Mediterranean Civilizations will 
prove helpful about individuals and monuments discussed in the lectures. 



Comments common to all Prof. Auteri's syllabi 
Student Contact Hours:  Thursday or by appointment

REQUIRED COURSE WORK  
 Students may need to allocate 3-5 hours each week outside of class time to master the material of 
the course. It is essential to keep up with the course material.  Students will be asked to solve problem 
sets. These can  be done in groups of 2-3 students and presented orally in class if asked.
 The lectures will emphasize the major topics and hopefully clarify what appears in the reading 
assignment.
 Problems will be used liberally to illustrate the major concepts. The basic readings should be done 
prior to the lecture to maximize your understanding. Since material not covered in the 
readings will often be discussed in the lectures, attendance should be considered necessary (i.e. 
mandatory) to derive full benefit from the course.
 
Miscellaneous 
 The final exam will include all course material covered throughout the entire semester. It is the 
student's responsibility to attend all exams.
 A "make-up" final exam will be provided in the event of illness only with a doctor's excuse. There 
will not be a make-up mid-term exam.
 Honor and Civility: While the basic medium for the class is the traditional lecture, there 
will be 
ample opportunity for questions, experiments, and discussion. Even in the midst of disagreement, the 
classroom will be constrained by traditional views on civility and manners. Civility refers to 
politeness and manners when interacting with other people. You can show respect for your fellow 
classmates and the teacher by arriving on time and treating each other with respect even when you may 
disagree over issues under discussion.  
Course Participation Guidelines  
Participation in discussions in the classroom is a vital part of student learning. Students will be 
graded on the quality and quantity of their input. The following guidelines wIll generally be followed:

Excellent Performance -- A range
 initiates information relative to topics discussed.
 accurately exhibits knowledge of assignment content
 demonstrates excellent listening by remaining on track with classroom discussion as demonstrated by 
relevant comments and questions
 brings up questions that needs to be further explored
 clarifies points that others may not understand
 draws upon practical experience or personal opinion, as appropriate
 offers relevant and succinct input in class
 actively participates in cases and classroom exercises
 demonstrates ability to apply, analyze, evaluate, and synthesize course material
 prepares all assignments on time, thoughtfully 
 Good Performance -- B range  
 regularly participates in discussion
 shares relevant information
 gives feedback to classroom discussions
 consistently demonstrates knowledge of reading assignments
 demonstrates ability to analyze and apply course material
 demonstrated willingness to attempt to answer questions
 prepares most assignments on time with some thoughtfulness 
 Fair Performance -- C range  
 participates in group discussion when solicited
 demonstrates some knowledge of course material
 offers clear, concise information relative to class assignment
 offers input, but tends to reiterate the intuitive
 attends class regularly
 prepares most assignments on time with some thoughtfulness 
Poor Performance -- D range 
 occasional input, often irrelevant, unrelated to topic or fails to participate, even when 
specifically asked in full class or group discussions
 reluctant to share information
 does not follow the flow of ideas
 drains energy from the class
 behaves towards others in a disruptive fashion (i.e., sarcastic comments) to those who participate 
regularly
 does not attend class regularly
 fails to prepare assignments on time or with thought  
 Unacceptable Performance -- F range  
 practically never provides unsolicited input
 input tends to be irrelevant, unrelated to topic or shows a lack of preparation
 reluctant to share information
 does not follow the flow of ideas
 drains energy from the class
 behaves towards others in a disruptive fashion (i.e., sarcastic comments) to those who participate 
regularly
 does not attend class regularly
 does little more than take up space in the room
 fails to prepare assignments on time or with thought   
Additional Suggestions  
Students should always remember that participation grades are highly subjective and depend entirely on 
the professor's interpretation of your efforts. It is imperative that students make proactive efforts to 
control their participation grade. In addition to the requirements listed above, it is highly 
recommended that every student take the time to introduce himself/herself to the professor multiple 
times early in the semester. Students should make an effort to be certain that the professor knows who 
they are and how much they are working toward a good grade!
GRADING

ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS 
 Course withdrawal and audit statuses are options for any student in this course. Regulations 
governing

 Introduction to Economics I (Micro)  
FALL & SPRING 
Prof. Monica Auteri 

Course Objectives: 
This is a principle course aimed at introducing the basic economic concepts of decision-making at a
micro level. In other words, we will study decisions and problems faced by individuals or firms, instead
of a whole economy. Then objectives of the course are 
 to familiarize the student with the basic concepts and methods of microeconomics -- the study of
how consumers and producers make their decisions and interact in markets, under conditions of perfect 
and
imperfect competition.
 to enable the student to apply these concepts and methods to policy issues . One important set of
policy issues is whether, when and how markets may fail and whether, when they fail, government
intervention may be needed to correct those failures.
 to lay the groundwork for future study: in the next term, for the study of macroeconomic issues
such as unemployment, inflation and long-run economic growth; and more generally for such courses as
managerial accounting and management decision-making, as well as economics courses in finance, labor, 
international economics and managerial economics, which require mastery of basic microeconomic concepts.

 Painting I  
On-Site & In-Studio 
FALL & SPRING 
Artist Giovanni Tommasi-Ferroni
General Description  
Since this course deals with painting, and since it is given in Rome, it will take into consideration 
the rich background of the City layered as it is with Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque.  
Before we begin we will have a discussion, first - of materials, then - of the elements of design 
because we should be aware of Line, Shape, Texture, Value, Volume, and Color.  These are not difficult 
to understand, but they will be important if the student is to try to render what will be before his/her 
eyes. 

Students are encouraged to bring whatever drawing materials they like to use.  If a student has not had 
much experience, a sketchbook 8.5" x 11" and a soft ebony pencil are sufficient to begin. Other 
materials can be experimented with later.  We will discuss the various properties of painting in 
Watercolor, Acrylic, and Oil, both on paper and on canvas.  It is best to work on a modest 
scale not larger than 11" x 14" for drawings and not larger than 18" x 24" for paintings, although once 
paintings are dry they can be rolled ( a bulky cumbersome portfolio can be a problem when traveling ).

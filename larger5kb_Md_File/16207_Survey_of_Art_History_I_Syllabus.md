**Required Texts** :  
_Art History_ , Volume 1 only (split) by Marilyn Stokstad, Prentice Hall,
Inc., 2002\. Note: You may also purchase, or may already own, the **combined**
volume in this series, instead of the half volume. Any edition is fine, and
the title and author are the same.

_A Short Guide to Writing About Art_ , by Sylvan Barnet, 6th edition, revised,
Addison-Wesley, 1999.

**Course Description** :  
The first part of the survey of western art history is an in-depth examination
of the art of the prehistoric period in Europe through the Gothic period. This
course will also continue to acquaint the student with western art history,
the critical process, and the production of art in order to achieve a well-
balanced appreciation for art and how it relates to the development of western
culture.

**Course Requirements** :  
There will be five exams, including the final exam. Four of the exams will
consist of slide identifications, definitions, multiple choice, and short
essay questions. One of the exams will be a "Museum Paper" which will be
outlined in a handout. Each exam, including the final exam, will be worth 100
points, or 20% of the course grade. The final exam will be cumulative. There
will be periodic quizzes throughout the semester, with each worth 5 points.
Your grade will be determined by the percentage of total points available
during the course that you accumulate by the end of the semester (400-475
points depending on how many quizzes we have). The grading system will be
based on the following scale: A (100-90), B (89-80), C (79-70), D (69-60), F
(59 and below). Class participation will determine your final grade. For
example, if you are on or near the border between grades (e.g. 87%-89%,
77%-79%) when I am calculating your final grade, participation will determine
which grade you will receive. Finally, any act of dishonesty, including
plagiarism and cheating, in academic work constitutes academic misconduct and
is subject to disciplinary actions. For further information read the
departmental [Academic Integrity
Policy](../Academic%20Integrity%20Policy.htm).

**Attendance** :  
Regular attendance and punctuality at all classes are required, and attendance
will be taken at each class. For each unexcused absence, 3 points will be
deducted from your overall grade. If the cause of the absence is excusable, I
may arrange for the student to make up for the missed work. (Note: Make up
tests, due to absences, are entirely dependent upon my discretion. You must
notify me prior to your absence. You may not make up missed quizzes, but if
you have a documented university-approved excuse for your absence, I will
double-count your next quiz.) The University Handbook states that for
freshman/sophomore courses you may have no more than the following unexcused
absences throughout the semester. If this amount is exceeded, you will fail
the course.  
  
_*** For classes meeting TR, you are allowed no more than 4 unexcused
absences**_.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
This course focuses on the ways that human sexuality has been described and
interpreted in the West. Situated at the boundary  
between the biological and the social, human sexual connection has been feared
for its explosive potential to disrupt all other forms  
of human organization, and has been interrogated as the key to understanding
human nature and individual identity. Sexual behavior  
has long been the object of religious and state proscription, and concerns
about it arguably underlie most methods of state control.  
Sigmund Freud, the quintessential theorist of modern sexuality, argued that
Eros andThanatos (Love and Death) ruled the world--  
humans are perpetually caught between elemental drives toward connection and
reproduction on the one hand, and dissolution and  
the destruction of all life on the other. In Classical Greece, sexuality and
sexual practice were inextricably bound to the education of  
the male citizen, and love was an aesthetic, spiritual, and corporal
experience, which, in Plato,s view was crucial to the right and true  
order of the Polis. While medieval Christians emphasized the association of
sex with sin, but insisted on the linkage of love with the  
divine and life everlasting, nineteenth century Victorians have been accused
of linking humans only by the callous, cash nexus.  
Many contemporary Western scholars argue that sexuality itself is a
historically contingent phenomenon enacting shifting power  
relationships of all sorts, and question the privileged place it has been
accorded in the explanation of human affairs. This course features  
a close reading of texts often viewed as classic expressions of Western
understandings and experiences of sexuality. Included will be  
works by Simone de Beauvoir, the Marquis de Sade, Freud, Krafft-Ebing, Mozart,
Adrienne Rich, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy.

**Postcolonial Memory: The Politics of Home**  
Prof. Meena Alexander

We will explore questions of personal memory, historical identity and
aesthetic self-fashioning in texts drawn both from the early era of
decolonization and the late twentieth century. How does memory bind one to
place? What happens when the sensuous density of a loved location can no
longer be taken for granted? What kind of identity can be said to come into
existence given a migratory, diasporic existence? And what of questions of
race and sexuality - how do they structure the grasp of the lived body and of
the evolving literary text? We will consider the tensions that come into play
given transnational narratives that fashion selves and refigure identities,
even as they focus on violence, traumatic memory, migratory homes and multiple
exiles. And what of the materiality of language as it cuts across the index of
place and gives voice to selves written across fraught, shifting, national
borders? In the course of exploring these and other questions we will
critically consider connections between the literary productions of
postcoloniality and contemporary American multiculturalism.

The texts we will consider will be drawn from the following: Mohandas K.
Gandhi, An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth; Frantz
Fanon, The Wretched of the Earth; Assia Djebar, Fantasia; Tsitsi Dangaremba,
Nervous Conditions; V.S. Naipaul, The Enigma of Arrival; Salman Rushdie,
Satanic Verses; Derek Walcott, Collected Poems; Arundhati Roy, The God of
Small Things; David Mura, The Colors of Desire; Theresa Cha, Dictee. We may
also consider narratives from the Partition of the South Asian subcontinent,
including the short stories of Sadat Hasan Manto and the oral testimonies of
abducted women; selected writings of Michelle Cliff and Toni Morrison;
selections from the works of Asian American writers: Maxine Hong Kingston,
Jhumpa Lahiri; Arthur Sze and Hisaye Yamamoto.

The theoretical materials on body, memory and hybrid identities will include
readings from some of the following: Gloria Anzaldua, Arjun Appadurai, Homi
Bhabha, Judith Butler, Cathy Caruth, James Clifford, Coco Fusco, Edmund
Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Edward Soja, Gayatri Spivak. Students in the
course are welcome to include materials pertaining to their own research
interests, including visual art, performance work, video and film.

Course requirements:  
The course will be run as a seminar with weekly student participation,
assigned readings and detailed discussion. One oral presentation and one
research paper 15-30 pages.

The texts for the course will be on order at Labyrinth Books, W.112 Street
between Broadway and Amsterdam, Tel: 212-865-1588.

T, 4:15-6:15 p.m.  
**The Age of Caxton: The Transition from Manuscript Culture to Print Culture
in the Late 15th Century**  
Prof. William Coleman

The course will examine the transition from manuscript to print culture during
the incunabulum period. (An incunabulum is a work printed in the 15th century-
literally, in the cradle of the age of printing.) It will discuss three
essential topics for the study of incunabula:

1\. the technology of early printing (i.e. how things got printed),  
2\. the patronage system and the economics of early printing (i.e. why things
got printed), and  
3\. the creation of the literary canon during the period of early printing
(i.e. what things got printed).

The course will study the development of printing in three different literary-
cultural environments: Germany, Italy, and England (i.e. where things got
printed). It will also discuss the work of the most prominent printers in
these three countries (i.e. who printed things) and, in particular, the work
of the first English printer, William Caxton.

Students will learn the standard bibliographical tools for research in 15th
century printing, plus the techniques of bibliographical description which
have been developed in the past few decades.

New York City libraries are particularly rich repositories of 15th century
printing. The New York Public Library, the Pierpont Morgan Library, and the
Grolier Club Library have extraordinarily important incunabula collections.
Arrangements will be made with the curators of these collections for students
to make supervised use of these materials.

T, 6:30-8:30 p.m.  
**Shakespeare's History Plays**  
Prof. W. R. Elton

Of the three dramatic genres listed in the Contents of Shakespeare's First
Folio (1623), this Histories remain the least adequately studied, though
certainly among his most important works. This course will examine, among the
histories, Henry IV, Parts I and II, Henry V. Richard II, and Richard III.
Other histories may be included as time allows. These plays will be studied in
their dramatic and poetic structure; in relation to the comedies and
tragedies; and in relation to the historical texts (e.g., Holinshed) from
which they derive.

Requirements: One ten-page paper, whose first draft is due at midterm. Texts:
Use the New Arden (now in its third edition), wherever possible. Become
acquainted with the techniques of research, and bibliographical tools.

Acquire and read through the New Companion to Shakespeare; and note Elton
essay on Shakespeare and Ideas. Acquire a sense of the relations and descent
of English monarchy. Be especially aware of the role of Falstaff with these
plays, and relations to comedy.

  * 71600  
Th, 2:00- 4:00 p.m.  
**Shakespeare in Context**  
Prof. Kate Levin

Shakespeare is regularly thought of as a unique and, by implication, solitary
genius: a playwright without peer -- and without peers. This course seeks to
correct that impression by reading a sampling of his plays alongside plays by
some of his contemporaries, colleagues and inspirations, including Marlowe,
Jonson and Middleton. In addition to striving for alert, nuanced readings of
all the plays we survey, the following questions may shape our inquiries: What
is specifically "Shakespearean" about Shakespeare's language or dramaturgy?
How much of his work depends on conventions established and promoted by
others? How do the playwrights we are reading register the influence of other
writers? Why has Shakespeare been canonized to the exclusion of other members
of the extraordinarily talented community of theater artists in which he
worked?

Requirements will include an oral presentation and related short paper, and a
longer final essay.

  * 74100  
Th, 4:15-6:15 p.m.  
**Revolution to Disillusion: British Literature & Culture of the Romantic
Age**  
Prof. Nancy Yousef

Beginning with the great cultural trauma of the French Revolution, this course
will serve as an introduction to issues, texts, and controversies central to
the Romantic period. We will pay particular attention to the effort to rethink
the realm of the social, for this is the principal legacy of the Revolution in
early nineteenth century culture. The limitations, possibilities, and grounds
of human relations (both personal and political) are persistent concerns
throughout this period, at times explicit, at times driven underground. The
course will be divided into three parts. In the first, we will address the
complex topic of the intellectual and cultural impact of the French Revolution
in England: the idealism and renewal the Revolution seemed to instantiate, the
disillusioning realization that a reign of terror could be unleashed under the
banner of fraternity and virtue, the impact of the political repression and
treason trials at home. The aspirations, challenges, and defeats of the 1790's
continued to exercise an influence on the work of important writers (such as
Wordsworth and Coleridge) whose careers extended into the next century. The
second part of this course will focus on the "turn to nature" in major works
of the first generation poets. We will consider how the dynamic between mind
and nature works variously as an occlusion, displacement, or recasting of
social and interpersonal concerns. We will conclude with a brief treatment of
the emergence of the "aesthetic" as flight from, and as fantastic fulfillment
of, the desire to establish social or affective bonds.

Authors will include Rousseau, Burke, Schiller, Wollstonecraft, Blake, Godwin,
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, Keats, and Hazlitt.
Recent theoretical approaches will be addressed throughout, the course, as
well as the long critical tradition that has made this so fruitful and
contested a period of study. Requirements: The course will be run as a seminar
with discussion and presentations on theoretical or historical topics relevant
to the week's reading. Students will submit a final paper on a topic of their
choice.

  * 74900  
Th, 4:15-6:15 p.m.  
**The American Renaissance**  
Prof. David Reynolds

Arguably the richest period in American literary history, the American
Renaissance (1830-65) features Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Poe,
Whitman, Dickinson, and others. This course places the major works in their
cultural and historical contexts. Emerson's transcendentalist philosophy and
literary theories are related to other key writings of the period, such as
Thoreau's Walden and Whitman's Leaves of Grass. The issues of slavery and race
relations are traced in a variety of texts, including Melville's "Benito
Cereno," the autobiographical Narrative of the ex-slave Frederick Douglass,
and Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Women's issues and other hotly debated social
topics are explored in Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, Margaret Fuller's
essays, and Dickinson's poetry. Among the other themes pursued are the issue
of class in an emerging capitalist economy, literary treatments of religion,
and the development of a distinctly American style. Melville's Moby-Dick is
investigated as a capacious meeting place of numerous themes and strategies of
the period. Key critical debates surrounding the period are also discussed.

  * 75100  
T, 4:15-6:15 p.m.  
**Experiments in Post-1945 American Poetry**  
Prof. Wayne Koestenbaum

The consoling chimera of "experiment" permitted American poetry to flourish in
the last half of the twentieth century. Without legislating which kinds of
prosody qualify as experimental and which do not, we will read the works of a
dozen or more poets who have attempted innovative subject or technique, and
whose effectiveness and influence stem from the strangeness of their methods.
Always we will be alert to questions of sound, muteness, brevity, length,
disclosure, stammering, dailiness, difficulty, and accident. We will read New
York School poets, Beat poets, Confessional poets, West Coast poets, and
several unclassifiables. Poets studied will include some of the following:
John Ashbery, James Schuyler, Barbara Guest, Robert Creeley, Susan Howe, Jorie
Graham, Allen Ginsberg, Michael Palmer, Myung Mi Kim, Alice Notley, Lyn
Hejinian, Frank Bidart, A.R. Ammons, Amiri Baraka, Robert Duncan, Anne Sexton,
and Anne Carson. (I would be pleased to receive syllabus suggestions from
prospective students.) If it is still in print, we will begin by reading
Donald M. Allen's 1960 anthology, The New American Poetry.

Requirements: oral presentation (including annotated bibliography of critical
responses to a particular poet), and an essay (20-25 pages, due at the end of
the semester).

  * 75200  
T, 6:30-8:30 p.m.  
**African American Literature I: Slave Narratives & the Literary Imagination**  
Prof. James De Jongh

Critical understanding of African American literature of the 19th century is
undergoing fundamental change today as a vast body of previously unknown
published work by black Americans is being uncovered and reprinted. The
Schomburg Collection of 19th Century Women Writers and The Periodical
Literature Project, both edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr., are two such sets of
exciting, new source materials. By focusing on the influential literary form
of the 18th and 19th century slave narratives, this seminar attempts to
present a coherent and comprehensive overview of the discourse of African
American literature, from its late 18th century beginnings to the turning
point represented by W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk (1903).

  * 75200  
W, 11:45 a.m.-1:45 p.m.  
**Race and Modernity: African American Literature from Fauset to Ellison**  
Professor Jon-Christian Suggs

This course tracks the gradual construction of the African American "modern,"
beginning with a generation of "Edwardian" sensibilities--Jessie Fauset,
W.E.B. Du Bois, Claude McKay, and Walter White. After them came the New
Negroes (Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Rudolph Fisher, and
the rest) and after them, the modern realists: Wright, Attaway, Motley, Himes,
and Ellison. Among all of these were the "sports" and anomalies, Jean Toomer,
Zora Neal Hurston, George Schuyler. Does this list suggest a developmental
paradigm in African American literary history or is it simply a chronology
without a story? If there is a story behind these writers and their texts
taken collectively, what is it?

  * 75600  
W, 4:15-6:15 p.m.  
**English Modernisms**  
Prof. Mary Ann Caws

A seminar discussing a few shapes assumed by various texts, written in the
English language, as seen within our present conceptions of modernism.
(Modernisms and conceptions deliberately take the plural form here, so as not
to limit presentations and arguments.) While some aesthetic movements and a
few tiny mags may insist on making their way into our space, we will place our
main focus on individual writings as well, in poetry and in prose.

We will strongly resist the temptation to separate off British modernism from
American modernism, even as the urge is present. Increasingly, what we see
looking back to the Great Age of Modernism is not two totally distinct
entities, but an impulse with two often interwoven strands. When the paths
seem separate, we will let them seem and be so; when not, not.

Two papers are required, the first before the term break, the second, by the
last class. Class reports. A roll call of the authors considered might well
include some, if not all, of the following: D.H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf,
Katherine Mansfield, James Joyce, W.B.Yeats, Wyndham Lewis, Ronald Firbank,
Henry Green; Henry James, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Wallace
Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy. Yes.

Th, 6:30-8:30 p.m.  
**19/20th Century Autobiographical Fictions**  
Prof. N. John Hall

There are all sorts of fascinating critical problems in autobiography-
beginning with the seemingly impossible problem of definition, and moving
through questions of readers' expectation, the ways in which autobiography
gives voice to particular groups, autobiography's relation to biography, etc.
But the crucial problem, for most critics and readers, is autobiography's
uneasy connection to and difference-if any- from fiction. It is said that all
autobiographies are fictions, and all (or almost all) fiction is
autobiographical-though clearly some fictions are seen as more autobiography
than others. This course will first consider contemporary theories of
autobiography (reasonably brief excerpts supplied in photocopy from Gusdorf,
Olney, Lejeune, Bruss, Easkin, Benstock, Abbott, Heilbrun, Mason, et al). Next
we will examine some 19th century novels generally regarded as especially
"autobiographical" and then move to formal autobiographies (for the novels,
ancillary material, noted here in parentheses, will be supplied in photocopy):
Dickens, David Copperfield (the famous "autobiographical fragment"); Charlotte
Bronte, Villette (selections of letters to M Heger); George Eliot, Mill on the
Floss (selected letters and poems); Trollope, Small House at Allington (first
three chapters from Trollope's An Autobiography); Edmund Gosse, Father and
Son; Gertrude Stein, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas; Mary McCarthy,
Memories of a Catholic Girlhood. Then we return to the novel, with Muriel
Spark, Loitering With Intent, seen in the context of her autobiography,
Curriculum Vitae. One session will be devoted to autobiographical criticism,
namely Nancy K. Miller's Getting Personal (selections supplied in photocopy),
with guest appearance by Prof. Miller. Time permitting, we shall look at
additional autobiographies, selected by the class: provocative possibilities
include, but are not limited to, Eunice Lipton, Alias Olympia; John Updike,
Self-Consciousness, Nuala O'Faolain, Are You Somebody: The Accidental Memoir
of a Dublin Woman. One oral presentation; one paper.

  * 78400  
Th, 2:00-4:00 p.m.  
**Satire in England**  
Prof. Blanford Parker

The course will cover all modes of satire in the long eighteenth century
(1660-1800). We will study Horace, Persius, and Juvenal as Classical models
for the formal verse satire; Rabelais and Cervantes as models of burlesque in
fiction; and Bacon and Hobbes as models for a general satire of human
knowledge.

The chief texts for the course will be the major satirical poems of Butler
(excerpted), Rochester, Dryden, Pope, Swift, Gay and Churchill. We will also
look at prose satire including: Sterne and Austen (the novel as satire), Hume
(philosophical discourse as satire), and Gibbon (history as satire).

We will also canvas the theory of satire in works of Jonson, Hall, Boileau
("L' Art Poetique"), Dryden ("Original and Progress of Satire"), Pope (Peri
Bathous), Johnson and others. We will discuss the significance of the change
from controversy to general satire in establishing the character of
Enlightenment rhetoric, and as a social and political underpinning for
establishment of the modern.

Th, 4:15-6:15 p.m.  
**Colloquium on the Teaching of Writing**  
Prof. George Otte

No other site of instruction has been such a testing ground for composition
pedagogy as the City University. Rich in approaches and answers to the many
questions besetting writing instruction, CUNY has produced an unusual number
of composition luminaries. Yet there is no grand consensus on the complex
issues of writing instruction, here or elsewhere. Beyond a general commitment
to improving teaching and learning, the field is characterized by tensions,
dilemmas, and debates regarding a variety of issues: assessment and
evaluation, kinds and genres of writing (e.g., personal vs. academic writing),
uses of technology, the relation of theory to practice, forms of cultural
assimilation and resistance, fluency vs. correctness (especially for non-
native speakers of English), and forms of classroom interaction (the so-called
de-centered classroom, collaborative learning, critical teaching, etc.). With
multiple perspectives on such matters to consider, the colloquium will eschew
a speaker-of-the-week approach; instead, every other week, the colloquium will
bring together at least two guests from CUNY's composition community who
represent different (often contrasting) perspectives on these topics,
alternating these discussions with weeks of reflective reading, discussion,
and writing. In addition, the course will entail a major project which may be
done individually or collaboratively.

**Teaching College English (Teaching Practicum)**  
Various Instructors

Required course for teaching interns.

Each CUNY college participating in the teaching internship program has a
practicum for interns tailored to that campus's student body and composition
philosophy, and taught by a college authority on composition. Participants
discuss theories of teaching composition and their actual experiences in the
classroom. Readings and course requirements vary from school to school, but
all students are trained in writing pedagogy. Classes usually take place at
the colleges. At registration, check with the English Program Office for the
names of instructors.

  * 79500  
W, 2:00-4:00 p.m.  
**Literary Scholarship**  
Prof. Gordon Whatley

The course aims specifically to help each student develop (1) expertise and
proficiency in literary research and the practice of literary and textual
criticism by working in depth on a single, representative short work of
literature, chosen by the student for its relevance to their own research
interests; and (2) to assess the evolution of modern critical methods and
trends, and their changing theoretical assumptions, as evidenced in the chosen
work's public reception and critical/interpretive history. Aimed primarily at
graduate students in the first or second year, the course is an opportunity to
experience dissertation research on a small scale. The class meets as a
workshop for the first eight or nine weeks: each student presents a weekly
report on the evolving stages of a focused project to produce a mini-edition
of his/her chosen work. These stages will include using traditional library
research tools and on-line resources to compile a comprehensive bibliography
of printed editions and other primary sources, and an annotated bibliography
of secondary sources (interpretive  & textual criticism, biography,
intellectual and cultural history): in short, all the materials necessary for
producing an annotated edition of the text with a critical introduction. The
introduction is an extended essay, synthesizing, and perhaps going beyond,
previous scholarship, in order to "situate" the work as an artistic production
in significant relation to its author's other works, and in the context of its
historical and cultural moment; the introduction will also describe the work's
critical reception over time and developing or declining status in the modern
literary canon. While a self-contained short work in verse by a "major" author
is ideal for the purposes of the course, short plays or prose works such as
stories, essays, sermons, etc., are also feasible (for obvious reasons, works
composed very recently, and lacking a developed critical tradition, are
impractical).

A general aim of the course is to help students familiarize themselves with
the character and scope of the discipline of literary scholarship as reflected
in their main field of interest, but the workshop structure of the course
exposes students to the tools and issues of the other fields and periods in
which their colleagues are engaged.

Students should select their semester projects before the first class, through
prior consultation with the instructor, either in person or via email. They
should also be aware that the course's emphasis on library research requires
an unusually heavy time commitment, especially during the first month or so.

W, 4:15-6:15 p.m.  
**Literature & Religion in the 19th Century: From Blake to Hopkins**  
Prof. Fred Kaplan

This course will deal with the centrality of religious belief and experience
to British Romantic and Victorian literature. We will discuss, as background,
nineteenth and twentieth-century theories of religion and some nineteenth-
century religious movements and controversies, particularly natural theology,
pantheism, evangelicism, unitarianism, the Oxford Movement, Methodism,
Christian socialism, biblical fundamentalism, Darwinism, and the Higher
Criticism. The emphasis, though, will be on how varieties of religious
experience and belief provide both fuel and spark for the literary
imagination. Among the authors from whom selections will be read are Blake
(Milton), Coleridge ("Aids to Reflection," "Church & State"), Shelley,
Prometheus, Carlyle ("Sartor Resartus"), Mill (Autobiography), Browning
(selected monologues), Tennyson ("In Memoriam"), Dickens (A Christmas Carol),
Eliot (Adam Bede), Arnold (Literature & Dogma), Swinburne (selected poems),
and Hopkins (selected poems & prose). Hopkins' synthesis of religion and
aestheticism is particularly important to the course. Students who want to
engage with similar dynamics in American literature will be welcome to
substitute or add Emerson or Stowe or Twain and extend knowledgability about
American forms of religious belief and revival in the 19th century. Twain's
satiric anti-religious views in the later works can serve as a powerful
representation of the literary imagination gaining great energy from anti-
Christian biblical inversion. Milton himself, of course, dominates the deep
background. But, from the late twentieth-century perspective, the overview
includes, for example, T.S. Eliot, William Buckley, and Jimmy Swaggert. There
will be additional optional readings and bibliographies for students preparing
for comprehensives. One brief oral report and one paper are required.

  * 80500  
T, 11:45 a.m.-1:45 p.m.  
**Introduction to Literary Theory**  
Prof. Nico Israel

This course is designed to introduce incoming graduate students to literary,
critical, and cultural theory. Issues to be examined include the nature of
language and the role of linguistics, the problems of the self and subject as
conceived by psychoanalysis, the relation of language to ideology, and
philosophical questions of hermeneutics, scepticism and truth. The latter part
of the course explores recent work on race, post-modernism, queer theory,
cultural studies, trauma studies, globalization and post-coloniality. Readings
to include essays by Benjamin, Adorno, Heidegger, Saussure, Lacan, Barthes,
L¨¦vi-Strauss, Fanon, Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard, Baudrillard, Habermas,
Jameson, Bhabha, Gilroy, Butler, Agamben and others. Prerequisites: Some
familiarity with twentieth century literature and philosophy will be helpful.
Students will be asked to write five 2-page position papers, one 5-7 page
midterm paper, and one 10-12 page final research paper, No auditors allowed.

**Technological Responses to Modernity**  
Gerhard Joseph

Through an interweaving of theoretical, fictional, and visual texts, this
course will explore the links during the past fifty years among systems
analysis, virtual thought chaos theory, cyberfiction, televisual/cinematic
culture, and hypertext. To periodize, have we moved from "modernity," not so
much into "postmodernity," as into the "posthuman"? How does a subject's
agency express itself in a cybernetic age, within the global empire of the
commodified and the "simulacral"? How are the new technologies transforming
the human sciences (not to mention the humanities more narrowly) from whose
disciplinary perspectives we belatedly describe consciousness and the world?
And if we buy into the thesis of radical metamorphosis, are we inclined to
indulge a dystopic, plangent nostalgia for what is passing on or to welcome a
new evolutionary stage for the species, a "reinvention of nature" (to use
Donna Haraway's utopic language)?

Some possible theoretical texts: selected essays surrounding the "Sokal Hoax,"
Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus; Thomas Kuhn, The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Michel Foucault, Power/Knowledge:
Selected Interviews and Other Writings. 1972-77; Jean Baudrillard, Selected
Writings; Umberto Eco, selections from Travels in the Hyperreal; Avital
Ronnel, The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, and Electric Speech;
Constance Penley and Andrew Ross, Technoculture; Scott Bukatman, Terminal
Identify: The Virtual Subject in Postmodern Science Fiction; Donna Haraway,
Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature; Mark Dery, Flame Wars:
The Discourse of Cyberculture; N. Catherine Hayles, Chaos Bound: Orderly
Disorder in Contemporary Literature and Science; James Gleick, Chaos; David
Bolter, Writing Space, George Landow, Hypertext. Some possible novels: Thomas
Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49 (or Gravity's Rainbow?); Don DeLillo, Ratner's
Star (or White Noise?); William Gibson, Neuromancer (or The Difference
Machine?); Neal Stephenson, Snow Crash; Samuel Delaney, Trouble on Triton;
Octavia Butler, Dawn; Joseph McElroy, Men and Women. Some video art: Laurie
Anderson, Bill Viola, Mona Hartoum, Shirin Neshet, and Nam June Paik. Some
films: Blade Runner, the two Terminator and three Alien films, Videodrome,
Robocop, Until the End of Time, Paris, Texas, The Matrix. Requirements: an
oral report and a term paper.

**Women's Mystical and Visionary Literature of the Later Middle Ages**  
Prof. Michael Sargent

The later medieval period in western Europe (ca. 1300-1450) saw the growth of
a vernacular mystical and visionary literature of which the major authors were
women: Mechtild of Hackeborn, Hadewijch of Brabant, Marguerite Porete,
Catherine of Siena, Bridget of Sweden and Elizabeth of Hungary are among the
best-known continental examples. Simultaneously, there grew up, particularly
among the convents of Dominican nuns and the beguinages of the Rhineland,
collections of lives of holy women in which mystical and visionary phenomena
were recounted as well. Although students will be encouraged to read these
works in their original languages, we will be dealing in this course with
those that were transmitted in Middle English translation: primarily
Marguerite (The Mirror of Simple Souls), Catherine (The Orcherd of Syon) and
Bridget (the Revelations, in one of their several versions), possibly Mechtild
(The Booke of Gostlye Grace) and Elizabeth (the Revelations), and the
anonymous collection of four women saints' lives in Bodleian MS Douce 114 -
and of course, the two prominent English writers in this field, Julian of
Norwich and Margery Kempe.

The level of difficulty of the language of these prose work is approximately
that of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Modern English versions of a number of
these texts are available, but their use for course work will be discouraged.

**The Renaissance & the Prestige of Modernity**  
Prof. Martin Elsky

Since Burckhardt's founding study of the Renaissance in the 19th century, the
prestige of the period has rested on its claim to be the inaugurating moment
of modernity. Starting with Burckhardt, this course will review a variety of
theories of modernity (some of the late 19th, but mostly of the 20th century)
as they relate to the Renaissance, and as they appear in literature, history,
art history, and philosophy. We will explore how the evolving definitions of
Renaissance modernity responded to 20th century movements and ideas such as
republicanism, fascism, feminism, the Early Modern, popular culture, and post-
coloniality. Topics will include the pre-World War I American model of the
Renaissance, the creation of a new American Renaissance school by emigres
fleeing European fascism, and the reconfiguration of Renaissance modernity in
Early Modernism and Transatlanticism. Primary texts will be drawn from, and
will address issues in English, continental, and transatlantic cultures, and
will be read in conjunction with representative theories of the modernity of
the Renaissance. An oral report and either one long or two short papers are
required. Because this is a cross-disciplinary course, students are encouraged
to introduce materials from their home discipline.

Renaissance Survey: Gender Issues  
Prof. Tom Hayes

The current (postmodern) argument that gender identity should be unfixed and
fluid has its roots in the Renaissance. It is not simply that some Renaissance
texts construct heterosexuality while others open the subliminal possibilities
for homosexuality, but that in several Renaissance texts gender--and hence
sexuality itself--is unstable and ambiguous. With this hypothesis in mind we
will try to determine how and why puritanism and homophobia became dominant
modes of thought in early modern England. We will also try to understand why
there can be no direct, unmediated relation between masculine and feminine
subject positions and how we might define sexual difference in a way that
encourages diversity and change.

We will read the following primary texts: Philip Sidney, The Countess of
Pembroke's Arcadia, Christopher Marlowe, Edward II, Shakespeare, The Sonnets
and Richard II, Ben Jonson, Epicoene and The Sad Shepherd, Thomas Middleton,
The Family of Love and Women Beware Women, John Webster, The White Devil,
Aemilia Lanyer, Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, Elizabeth Cary, The Tragedy of
Miriam, Eleanor Davies, Prophetic Writings, Anna Trapnel, Visions and Poems,
Andrew Marvell, Lyric Poems John Milton, Samson Agonistes

Theoretical and historical studies: Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality
and Herculine Barbin, Thomas Laqueur, Making Sex; Jonathan Goldberg,
Sodometries ; Allen Bray, Homosexuality in Renaissance England; Valerie Traub,
Desire and Anxiety; Catherine Belsey, The Subject of Tragedy; Comensoli and
Russell, eds., Enacting Gender; Epstein and Straub, eds., Body Guards

respond in writing to everyone else's work, and that the pages to be discussed
will be circulated among members of the workshop at least a week ahead of
time.

**Milton's Poetic Volumes: 1645, 1671, 1673**  
Prof. Joseph Wittreich

We will start with Justa Edovardo King naufrago (1638), the volume in which
Lycidas first appears and which itself provides a pattern, a design for the
1645 Poems of Mr. John Milton and 1673 Poems,  &c.; upon Several Occasions,
both of which, along with "Paradise Regain'd" . . . To which is added "Samson
Agonistes" are at once illustrative of and paradigmatic for poetic volumes
conceived not only as gatherings of poems but as themselves a poem. Or as
Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote to the publisher of Lyrical Ballads, the poems
themselves are but the stanza of an ode, which is the volume itself; or as
Robert Frost quips, where there are twenty-five poems published together, the
twenty sixth is the poetic volume. Milton's poetic volumes were the means by
which some later poets conceptualized their poetic volumes and theorized their
projects, much as critics would later do in a volume like Poems in Their
Place, edited by Neil Fraistat, or in the many more recent discussions of the
idea of the book, or in the on-going "Book" seminar (under the aegis of Peter
Stallybrass) at the University of Pennsylvania. Our initial concern will be
with how poets contextualize their own poems through organization and
placement--a concern, in the last third of the course, that will give way to
other contextualizations as illustrated by Samson Agonistes. Indeed, Milton
seems to encourage alternative contextualizations to those currently in
fashion, thus not only (not even principally) Aeschylus and Sophocles, but
Euripides and Seneca, along with the biblical tradition of tragedy as its is
exemplified by the Book of Revelation or by Christ suffering, both of which
Milton foregrounds through citation in his preface to Samson Agonistes. Our
largest concern will be with what new editions of Milton, with what a new
Milton criticism, will look like in the next century and new millennium.

Required text: Milton: Complete Shorter Poems, ed. John Carey, 2nd edition.
London and New York: Longman, 1997.

Seminar requirements: (1) an oral presentation and (2) a final paper (15 to 20
pages in length).

**American Aesthetics: William & Henry James**  
Prof. Joan Richardson

Discussions in this seminar will focus on the various facts and facts of
feeling that contributed to the emergence of the Jameses' distinctively
performative styles. Particular attention will be given to the impact of the
Darwinian information, the significance of the visual, the concern with
language and consciousness, and the later 19th century American scene. In
addition, certain texts of Swedenborg, Emerson, and Peirce will be considered
in their informing relations to the work of both William and Henry.

Those registering for the seminar are encouraged to read over the summer
William James's The Principles of Psychology (1890, unabridged version,
available in a one volume Harvard U.P. paperback). Other readings during the
term will include Henry James's Portrait of a Lady, The Turn of the Screw, The
Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors, The Golden Bowl, selected prefaces to the
New York Edition, "The Art of Fiction"; William James's Varieties of Religious
Experience, and selected letters from the brothers' correspondence.

Weekly response papers will be required instead of seminar reports. A term
paper will also be required.

**Naturalism & Aestheticism: Encountering the Other**  
Prof. Norman Kelvin

Naturalism and Aestheticism begin in France in the Nineteenth Century; and,
from my perspective, are reactions to the failure of the Revolution of 1848.
By Common agreement Zola is the paramount figure in Naturalism; and in
retrospect Flaubert takes on the role in Aestheticism. Zola, who grew up in
the France shaped by the defeat of the Revolution, by its devolution into the
Second Empire, makes "science" a substitute for dreams of a better future.
Flaubert, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley's "true Penelop" (as he was for Henry James),
substitutes formal excellence for political hope. But this mutual beginning as
response to a political event in France is lost when the two movements enter
Anglo-American literary discourse. At first they try to be autonomous; but by
the end of the century they reinscribe themselves in political imagining, this
time British and American. In addition, they encounter each other, both as
binary opposites and as a presence, each within the other (as they did
earlier, in France, too). From the later encounter, new forms emerge, and this
cultural shift requires a reassessment of both movements in their second
phase. In our course, we begin with Flaubert's Sentimental Education and
Zola's Germinal. We follow with works by Huysmans, Barbey, Villiers, Peter,
Wilde, Ella D'Arcy,, Violet Paget, James, Virginia Woolf, and Edith Wharton,
all these viewed as aestheticist texts marked by naturalist devices. Novels of
the Goncourt brothers, George Moore, Stephen Crane and Jack London will be
read as naturalist works in which aestheticist concerns are present. We will
also note that at the very time aestheticism begins to define Modernism in
England and France, Naturalism means modernity in America. Finally, we will
see that Aestheticism in the visual arts crosses the Atlantic with greater
ease than it does in the novel, and ask why this should be so. Background
readings include theoretical approaches to our topic (a list will provided).
Requirements are a class presentation and a term paper.

**Non-Oedipal Psychologies**  
Prof. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick

This is an experimental seminar that will explore historical and contemporary
alternatives to the psychological models that have the most currency in
present literary studies. The dominant, Lacan-inflected reading of Freudian
psychoanalysis embodies many assumptions that have been questioned, whether
from within or outside of psychoanalytic thought. Among them are the
interpretive isolation of the mother-father-child triad; the determinative
nature of childhood experience and the teleology toward a sharply distinct
state of maturity; the primacy of genital morphology and desire; the
centrality of dualistic gender difference; and the emphasis on linguistic
models of mental functioning. In this seminar we will look for interesting
alternative currents of psychological thought in writers who may include
Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Wollstonecraft, Ruskin, Freud, Ferenczi,
Klein, Tomkins, Deleuze, Balint, and Bollas. Seminar participants will also
pursue and share individual/small group research on ancient, medieval, and
non-Western psychological traditions.

**Women Writers and Intellectuals: 1940s-1970s**  
Prof. Nancy Miller

Can women writers gain cultural authority as public intellectuals only by
dismissing or refusing feminism? Beginning with Virginia Woolf, we will
examine the work of major writers from England, France, Germany, and the
United States, who produced essays, novels, and poetry from the war years
through the advent of second-wave feminism. Mary McCarthy, Hannah Arendt,
Simone Weil, Elizabeth Hardwick, Simone de Beauvoir, Doris Lessing, Susan
Sontag, H¨¦l¨¨ne Cixous, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Christa Wolf, and Julia
Kristeva. Prominent cultural figures and intellectuals, these women have often
played an important role in public debate but many have refused the category
of gender as relevant to their positions. What kinds of values and views--
aesthetic, psychological, social--have led many women writers to dismiss or
refuse feminism? We will consider this process directly and indirectly through
a certain number of recurrent preoccupations: writing, sexuality, art, taste,
identity, style, politics, violence, war, and so on. We will end the semester
with a discussion of contemporary feminist and postfeminist writing.

Work for the course: one oral presentation, one short paper, and one term
paper, due at the end of the semester.

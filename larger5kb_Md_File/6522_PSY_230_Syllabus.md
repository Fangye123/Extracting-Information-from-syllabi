**COURSE PREREQUISITE** : Psychology 101 - Introductory Psychology Only
students who have completed Psychology 101 may be enrolled in this class.  
  
  
**COURSE CONTENT** : The course begins with the philosophical and historical
background of the discipline of Developmental Psychology. Next, the scientific
methods, data collection and analyses, hypothesis testing, and statistical
tests pertinent to the field are outlined. A variety of developmental theories
then are compared, and evidence relevant to the nature-nurture question is
presented. Following this general overview, a chronological history of the
psychological development of the normal individual occurs, beginning with
conception and prenatal development and continuing through infancy, early and
middle childhood, adolescence, young and middle adulthood, and old age.
Throughout the course, an effort is made to acquaint the students with the
strengths and limitations of our knowledge in this field, and to provide the
students with the skills necessary to understand and critically analyze the
relevant social phenomena which they will encounter in their lives.  
  
  
**CLASSROOM POLICIES:**  
  
Any student who decides to no longer attend this course must complete any
necessary paperwork required of the Office of the Registrar. Note that
students who either no longer attend this class or stop attending all classes
at this university must also formally drop classes through the Reg. Line and
the Office of the Registrar.  
  
All examination papers, reports, and other class papers become the property of
the instructor and may be retained by her.  
  
No tape-recording equipment of any kind may be used during classroom lectures.  
  
If a student misses a class, it is his/her responsibility to obtain the
lecture notes from another student.  
  
  
**GRADING POLICIES:**  
  
All exams comprise multiple-choice questions. Each student is expected to
present a pictured-identification card at each exam. Assignment of seating in
the exams is at the discretion of the instructor.  
  
Questions on the exams will be based on information in the assigned textbook
and from classroom lectures. Much of the text material, particularly in the
latter part of the course, will not be covered in lecture. Any student who has
difficulty reading or understanding any of the text material, should bring it
up in class.  
  
**Make-up Exams** : Points will be lost for taking exams late. See instructor
for scheduling.  
  
The grade of "Incomplete" will not be given in this course. A "zero" grade
will be assigned to any test which is missed and not made-up prior to the
fourth exam. No make-ups will be permitted on the fourth exam.

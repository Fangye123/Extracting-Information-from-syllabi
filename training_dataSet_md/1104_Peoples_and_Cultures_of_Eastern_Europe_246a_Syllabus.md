### Course Description and Goals

The primary goal of this class is to foster in students an understanding and
appreciation of "the other Europe"-- the peoples and cultures located between
the German-speaking populations of Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.
This includes the majority and minority populations of present-day Poland, the
Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and
the successor states of Yugoslavia. The perspective from which we will examine
this remarkable human and cultural diversity is a multidisciplinary one;
history, political science, economics, literature, art, and sociology all
provide avenues of understanding and insight. Of special interest, however,
are the problems of culture history, societal integration, ethnic identity,
and social change that are illuminated by the uniquely holistic perspective of
anthropology. In a basic sense, we will simply be trying here to learn as much
as we can about this intriguing, but exceedingly troubled, area of the world.
But at a deeper level, we will be grappling with two crucial problems: why
there is an Eastern Europe, and what significance does its existance and its
experience hold for humanity.

Questions to which we will seek enlightening answers in this class include:
Who are these people of Eastern Europe? How long have they been here and from
where did they come? What claims have they made to the territories they
occupy? Why and how have they retained their individual ethnic identities?
What other dimensions of identity (class, occupational, regional, gender,
religious, cultural) have been prominent in the lives of East Europeans? How
have their identities evolved and intertwined through history? How different
and similar are the various peoples of Eastern Europe in their values, world-
views, life-ways? How have nations, states and empires been constructed out of
this diversity, and how have the East European nations fitted into the world
system? What was the impact of Soviet-imposed totalitarian systems upon
indigenous psyches and social structures? What factors led to the demise of
the Communist system? What does the post-Communist terrain look like? Where
are these nations and peoples now going? What should be the response of the
West to their struggles? **College Requirements and Credits** There are no
prerequisites for the course. I assume that most students have little or no
prior knowledge of this world area and its peoples. SOAN 246 satisfies the
college's GEC VI requirement (Encountering Other Cultures). It also carries
credit as a general elective and counts towards both the anthropology and
sociology majors.

#### Course Requirements and Components for Evaluation

  
1\. Consistent attendance.  
2\. Careful and timely reading of assigned materials and preparation for class  
3\. Active and positive participation in class discussions and small group
activities  
4\. Map quiz  
5\. Peoples quiz  
6\. History quiz  
7\. Ethnographic narrative. A 5-10 page reseach-based, type-written, first
person account of a fictional person's life in the 20th Century. There is a
great deal of latitude as to the form your account may take (a letter, poem,
stream-of-consciousness recollection, conversation, interview), but all
narratives should include an expository preface laying out the historical
context of the individual's experiences. Your reading of Hoffman and Kaplan
should give you some good ideas. A more comprehensive guideline will be handed
out in class. Due date: May 13.  
8\. Group work and class presentation. Students in the class will be broken up
into nine groups, one for each of the seven former Soviet-bloc nations, and
two minority population groups (Romany/Gypsies and Jews). Over the course of
the semester each group will assume some special responsibilities and work
together on a number of in-class exercises. In the latter half of the
semester, during the week devoted to "your nation", you and your group
colleagues will make some form of presentation to the class. There is also a
great deal of latitude as to the format of this presentation. Whatever its
form, it should be creative and informative, providing insight into the
character of the people you represent. A guideline will be provided.  
9\. Maintenance of an active class notebook (three-ring binder, loose-leaf).
This should be organized into discrete sections: 1)an assignment page, 2)
class notes, 3)reading and research notes, 4) journal-essay section (see
below). Your notebook should provide me with clear indication of your active
engagement with the class and a sustained and serious effort to learn.  
10\. Journal-essays. In this section of the notebook you should write down
your thoughts and queries, problems and puzzlements, as you learn about the
peoples and cultures of Eastern Europe. The shape and character of these
journals will vary from student to student. For those of you of East European,
Jewish, and Romani heritage, the journal might well become a personal document
of self-discovery. Others among you may find yourselves standing outside of
the East European experience, looking on it all with objective, detached
interest. Whatever form they take, the journals will provide me with crucial
information on the depth and character of your understanding of this area of
the world. You should report here the "dawning" of important insights,
disagreements you may have with me and other sources of information, questions
that you need to have answered, significant shifts in your perspective. You
should try to include at least one entry each week, dating and keeping them in
chronological order. I will occasionally provide you with specific questions
or problems to address in your journals, and specific deadlines for submission
will be given. Please abide by them. I will return these essays to you, with
my comments and evaluation, for inclusion in your notebook-- where, I hope,
you will comment on my commentary. At the end of the semester your entire
journal section will be turned in for critical evaluation. This will also
serve as a central focus of discussion at your oral final (see below).  
11\. Oral final. Over the last two weeks of class, I will meet with all
students in 20 minute individual conferences to discuss their understanding of
Eastern Europe. Journals will provide us with focal points for discussion, and
I will pose to you critical questions highlighted over the course of the
semester.  
12\. Final examination. The scheduled two-hour period for "the final"
(Wednesday, May 25, 3:30-5:30 PM) will be reserved for students to have a
final opportunity to convey to me what they have learned about Eastern Europe.
A re-take option will be then available for the three quizzes, as well as an
option to respond in written form to questions posed during the oral final.

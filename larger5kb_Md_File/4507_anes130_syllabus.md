**Course Description** :  
This is the first course in a three quarter sequence that examines the human
dimensions of global environmental change from the perspective of the Third
World. This course lays the conceptual and substantive foundation for the
following two courses in the sequence and is a prerequisite for them. The
Third World (also referred to as the Developing World, the "South," Emerging
Nations, Emerging Economies, Poor Countries, Less-Developed Countries, etc.)
is comprised of a number of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that
account for more than one half of the world's peoples and are characterized by
certain broad similarities in geography, history, demography, economy, and
resource utilization. Despite these similarities, it is difficult to
understand the Third World without placing it in a global context in which the
Third World and the First World are overlapping and connected in increasingly
complex ways. In particular, this course will address the sociocultural
context of environmental destruction from an interdisciplinary perspective,
which integrates social, cultural, economic, and political factors as well as
biological, physical, human demographic, and environmental parameters.

The course is divided into three broad sections. We will first explore
meanings and measures of the Third World, including the institutions which
shape the history of Third World development and environment. Next, we will
consider several inter-connected conceptual frameworks for addressing human-
environment relationships, including globalization, famine and hunger,
sustainability, population, gender, and property regimes. This section will
end with a discussion of political ecology, which is a useful approach to
integrating a variety of factors in understanding the complexity of human-
environment relationships. In the final section of the class, we will focus on
specific development interventions and their consequences in the Third World,
and how these are intertwined with environmental use, degradation, and
conservation, such as forestry, fishing, protected areas, industrialization,
and oil extraction.  
  
**A Caveat:  
** We will find as this course goes on that the human and environmental
problems we examine have at their core the conflicting values and beliefs of
the various human groups involved - contending values that determine
environmental and social policy. In this class we will spend a lot of time
examining dissenting points of view, including those held by various members
of the class. This course requires students to scrutinize/express their own
values and beliefs (sometimes a difficult process) as well as hear contending
points of view from others in the class (sometimes from the instructor).
Intense discussions are encouraged but vicious and/or personal attacks will
not be tolerated and anyone engaging in them will be required to leave the
class (and will be dropped from the course). My goal is to have a classroom
setting in which students feel comfortable expressing different points of
view, whether those points of view differ from my own or those of other
members of the class. This is not only an issue of freedom of speech but also
one of academic enhancement and growth. Moreover, I believe that solutions to
the environmental and human problems considered in this class can only be
found after contending points of view (including the values and belief systems
that shape policy) are brought out into the open. **

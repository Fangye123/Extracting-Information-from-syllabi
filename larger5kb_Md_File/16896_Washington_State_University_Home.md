NOTE: This class fulfills an I (Intercultural) requirement.

**Course Description:**  
This course provides an introductory overview of the study of race, ethnicity,
and culture in the modern United States. Using literature, historical
documents, and film, we will focus on the historical forces behind the
arrival, settlement, growth, and redistribution of all of America's peoples.
Together we will investigate particular histories unique to each group, as
well as those overarching similarities that connect each of these distinct
groups to a shared history. We will also discuss the present-day relevance of
these myriad American histories.

This is also a reading intensive course. Together we will read six of the most
interesting work of literature written in the 20th Century, and we will
explore how each of these texts tells us something about diversity in America.
But you have to be willing to read, to think, and to learn.

**Books:** (at the "Bookie")  
Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan of the Apes  
Henry Roth, Call it Sleep  
Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man  
Sandra Cisneros, The House on Mango Street  
Sherman Alexie, Indian Killer  
Tony Horwitz, Confederates in the Attic

**Course Assignments and Requirements:**  
1\. As class participation in vitally important here, you are allowed only two
excused absences. Every additional absence reduces your final grade by one
grade (e.g. from a B+ to a B).

2\. All writing assignments must be in 12 point, Times New Roman, double-
spaced, and with one inch margins. Every deviation from this formula \- each
use of an unacceptable font or margin size - will result in 2 points off of
each paper, with a possibility for as many as 14 points off any given paper.

3\. There are no quizzes, tests, or exams in this class. Students are
responsible for writing a five-page analysis papers on any four books or
movies of their choosing. This is not a book review assignment - I want a
thoughtful consideration and elaboration of the main arguments of each novel,
and I want you to connect the books to our own present day concerns. Each
writing assignment is due the first day of the next section of class!!! In
other words, if you wanted to write on Tarzan, it would be due on February 9,
2001. As part of these four papers, everyone MUST write on Horwitz,
Confederates in the Attic.

4\. Unofficial extra credit points are earned during discussion section;
official extra credit points are earned with three page analysis papers of in-
class movies and occasional extra-curricular projects.

**Grading:**  
Each of the five-page papers is worth 20% of your final grade. The final 20%
is earned through good attendance, frequent class participation, and extra
credit.

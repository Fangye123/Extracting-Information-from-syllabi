> This course provides the basis for understanding the various Asian American
cultures, past and present. We will cover six major Asian American groups:
Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, Filipino Americans, Korean Americans,
Americans from the Indian subcontinent, and Americans from Southeast Asia.
Remember that the experiences of each group were shaped by the experiences of
those who preceded them; therefore, our understanding will be cumulative
rather than serial. We will consider how the experience of immigration
differed for each group, and what all had in common. We also will contrast
those experiences with those of European immigrants. In what ways did
ethnically-defined ("white") immigrants differ from racially-defined
immigrants from Asia? How did their receptions in America differ, and were
immigration laws different for Asians than for Europeans?

>

> Immigrants and their descendents were not simply victims, of course. We will
study how each group responded to their respective circumstances. What kinds
of communities did they build? What jobs did they find? What forms did their
artistic expression take? How did they affect the world around
them&emdash;their towns, their cities, their nation? Have they contributed
only to the margins of American culture and society, or are they part of the
very core of American culture? Readings will be supplemented by film, music,
and other media presented in class.

> Keep a copy of all submitted work. No extra credit or paper re-writes will
be permitted, but consultants at the Writing Center will be prepared to assist
you with your midterm essay, as will the instructor. In-class exercises cannot
be made up for any reason because group interaction is irreproducible. Late
assignments will be accepted only in extenuating circumstances that could not
have been anticipated. Keep all graded materials until you receive your final
course grade.

> I insist on academic honesty. You are responsible for understanding all
aspects of University regulations regarding academic honesty. Acts of academic
dishonesty, including but not limited to **cheating** (e.g., copying another
person's work or obtaining examination answers in a dishonest manner) and
**plagiarism** (i.e., using another person's words or ideas without
acknowledgment) may result in a zero for the assignment or examination. Note
that American rules regarding plagiarism might differ markedly from those in
other countries. You can find more information in the University Handbook. I
will help you any way I can so you do not have to resort to dishonesty. I
truly want you to succeed. Visit my office hours often!

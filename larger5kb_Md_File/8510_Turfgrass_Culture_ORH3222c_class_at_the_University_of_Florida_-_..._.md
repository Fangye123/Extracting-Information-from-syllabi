public libraries and can be purchased commercially.  An excellent reference
source, though many years old, is Beard, J. B.  1972.  [Turfgrass Science and
Culture](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/013933002X/qid=934919721/sr=1-1/002-3725862-3674846).  
  
**Other activities:**   There will be an all-day trip to visit turf
facilities, including a golf course, a sod farm, and lawns.

**Consultations:**   By appointment (preferably) and drop-in (if I am
available).  Available usually Monday 3:00 to 5:00, for short visits, other
times by appointment.  
  
**Suggestions:**   You are encouraged to attend all classes and read the
textbook ahead of the lectures.  
  
**Grading:**   The course grade will be determined from a combination of three
1-hour exams, a final exam, an electronic term paper, the term
[e-paper](epaper.html), and class and lab participation.  Exam scores will
derive at least 50% from multiple-choice questions.  There will be no make-up
exams.   However, students who present unavoidable conflicts may make advance
arrangements to take an oral exam.  Class participation, which determines at
least 10% of the grade, is based on regular attendance, asking questions in
class, and being helpful to other students.  Grading: A=90%+; B+=85-89.9%;
B=80-84.9; C+=75-79.9%; C=70-74.9; D+=65-69.9; D=60-64.9%; E=less than 60%.  
  
**Academic honesty:**   As a result of completing registration, every student
has also previously signed the following statement:  "I understand that the
University of Florida expects its students to be honest in all their academic
work.   I agree to adhere to this commitment to academic honesty and
understand that my failure to comply with this commitment may result in
disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from the University."

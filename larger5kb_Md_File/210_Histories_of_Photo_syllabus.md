**_COURSE OVERVIEW_**  
In this course, we will study photographic art production in the twentieth
century, placing a strong emphasis on its relationship to the social,
political and economic circumstances in which it was created. While focusing
primarily on photography in relation to art practice, we will look
peripherally at other uses of photography (such as journalism, amateur and
commercial applications) and at the interplay between the various practices.

**_CLASS REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING BREAKDOWN_**  
1\. Mid-term exam 30%  
2\. Final exam 60%  
3\. Class participation: preparation for discussions and in-class answers to
readings: 10%

**_EXAMS_**  
For the two exams students will be expected to synthesize and apply concepts
from the readings and lectures. This does not mean memorizing names and dates
as much as understanding concepts and ideas. Therefore in order to pass exams,
attendance at class lectures (or obtaining the missed material from another
student in the class) is required. There is no make-up time for the exams, so
those not in attendance at the exam will not receive credit.

**_READINGS_**  
Required readings will be theoretical and historical. On occasion, questions
will be given in conjunction with a reading. While these may not be collected,
students may be called on in class (for credit) and will be expected to have
prepared answers to the questions.

**_PROBLEMS?_**  
Please feel free to meet with me during my office hours to discuss any problem
you are having with this class, whether it is with readings or with ideas
presented in class. _Do not wait until you are studying for the exams to
realize you do not understand what has been covered! Keeping up with your
readings and lectures is a way to enjoy this class, eliminate stress (!)
and....do well._

**_ATTENDANCE_**  
In the case of an excused absentee, student will provide a _written_ excuse or
a doctor's note. Student will be allowed two unexcused absentees during the
quarter. After this limit, each unexcused absentee will automatically lower
student's grade one half a letter grade. Arriving to class late, forgetting to
sign attendance sheet or signing and leaving early will be counted as absentee
on the student's record.

**_REQUIRED READING_**  
A required course-packet for the class is available at **Cal Copy Comp &
Foto**  
La Jolla Village Sq., 8657 Villa La Jolla, Tel: 452-9949

**_Handouts_**  
Handouts for the lectures will be available at least one hour before each
class ON Line at (address to be announced in class)

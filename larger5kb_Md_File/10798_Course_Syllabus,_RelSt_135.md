## LECTURE OUTLINE & ASSIGNMENTS (Fall 2001)

This course deals with the origins of "Christianity" in general, to about the
year 200 ce, with particular reference to the various documents preserved from
early Christians, including the "New Testament" anthology. The primary goal of
the course is to **understand** what took place in this complex period,
without consciously importing later ideas or imposing later value judgments
upon the materials. It is thus concerned more with history and the history of
ideas than with today's religious perspectives as such, although the study can
have great relevance for understanding certain attitudes in modern circles
interested in Christian and Jewish heritages. Grasp of **METHOD** of
historical investigation is of primary importance.

Evaluation of student performance for grading purposes will rest on several
factors, but especially the following:  
  
\- informed class participation (do the readings beforehand!),  
\- a major research paper due at the end of classes,  
\- a comprehensive final review (written and/or oral).

Every student will be expected to have a computer account on the Internet and
to keep in regular contact with the instructor by that means. Students are
encouraged to join or monitor at least one academic discussion group
(IOUDAIOS-L, ELENCHUS, or EccHst-L are recommended) and to learn to access
other relevant materials at the instructor's [ home
page](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/rak/kraft.html) and elsewhere (learn to
search the net with google.com and similar tools).

There are various resources from which the pertinent information may be
gathered, and students are encouraged to explore a wide range of modern
treatments and interpretations. The assignments will be based on the following
books that have been ordered in the Penn Bookstore, but it is possible to
cover the same material from other books and resources as well, in accord with
the stated topics. Of the modern "secondary" works, Ehrman (also Tyson) is
written for college level classes such as this; Koester is more advanced
(graduate level), and may prove to be more challenging, but hopefully no less
rewarding! Note that individual students may choose the specific "track" by
which they acquire information, all the way from using the Internet, the
bibliography and the library resources, to using a fixed body of "textbooks."

## Sequence of Foci (Course Outline and Topical Assignments)

### 1\. ESTABLISHING A BASIS FOR APPROACHING THE MATERIALS

For this part of the course, read introductory sections that deal with
"methodological" and background issues, as in EHRMAN chs 1+14+29 [or TYSON]

article on the sweep of Christian history would also be useful.

sections of the [ NT
Gospels](http://www.mindspring.com/~scarlson/synopt/index.html) (synoptics and
John; see Gospel Parallels as a convenient tool) and the [ "apocryphal
Gospels"](http://wesley.nnu.edu/noncanon/gospels.htm) (e.g. in EHRMAN Red &
Green ch 8). See also HOPKINS chs 4 & 8, and [ RelSt

"apocryphal" Acts](http://wesley.nnu.edu/noncanon/acts.htm) and [ non-
canonical Pauline materials](http://wesley.nnu.edu/noncanon/writings.htm)
(EHRMAN Red & Green ch 8). See also [ RelSt

here, rather loosely. Read the secondary treatments for attempts at synthetic
reconstruction (e.g. EHRMAN chs 25-28, HOPKINS chs 3 & 6-7), and explore the
various primary sources listed below (see EHRMAN Red and Green, and the [
"Noncanonical Homepage"](http://wesley.nnu.edu/noncanon/)). See also [ RelSt

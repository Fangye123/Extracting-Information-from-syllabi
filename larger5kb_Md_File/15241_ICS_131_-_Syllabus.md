### Course Description

    
    
    This course provides you with an introduction of computerization as a
    social process.  It examines the social opportunities and problems raised
    by new information technologies, and the consequences of different ways of
    organization.  Topics include computerization and work life, privacy,
    virtual communities, productivity paradox, systems risks.

### In-class exercises

    
    
    
    Most Tuesdays and Thursdays involve either an in-class exercise (done
    in pairs) or a quiz (open-book, done alone).  For the in-class
    exercises, there is sometimes a pre-class preparation, but usually, there
    isn't.  Full credit requires making one of your group presentations to
    the class. Students will be called on randomly from the roster to make the 
    brief presentation.
    

### In-class quizzes

    
    
    Typically, an in-class quiz is
    open-book, focuses on one reading for that week.
    

### Notebooks

    
    
    Your Course Notebook will contain one-page reviews of each assigned
    reading, along with the topic summaries and materials collected for
    discussion section activities. The Notebook will be graded the third,
    sixth, and final weeks.
    

### Notebook article reviews

    
    
    Each review should be on a separate page or pages, headed by the article's
    title and author. The review should first indicate the style (e.g. academic
    or informal) and audience for the article, then summarize in a few clear
    sentences the main argument of the article. Then you should describe your
    reaction or a personal experience related to the article of a part of it.
    Your personal experience, insight, reaction, or reasoned argument is
    essential.
    

### Topic summaries (with outside material)

    
    
    The readings are divided into six topics. You will write three 3-to-5 page
    (double-spaced, 12pt times roman or 10pt other fonts)
    section summaries, each tying together material from the assigned articles
    in one section. It should also cite 2 new sources; one can be another
    reading in the book, the second should be an outside source. Each summary
    should also contain your opinions and experiences related to the material
    in the section. Your first summary will cover the first reading topic. For
    your second summary you can choose either the second or third topic. Your
    third summary will cover one of the final three topics.
    

### E-group participation

    
    
    Everyone posts at least 3 messages to the 131 E-group: your reaction to an
    assigned reading, and two responses to postings by other students.
    

### Discussion section activities and participation

    
    
    Some activities in discussion section require advanced preparation.
    

### Policy on missed exercises, missed quizzes, and late Notebooks

    
    
    In-class activities cannot be made up unless the instructor is notified in
    advance of the absence or the student has a note from a medical doctor. 
    Notebook entries must be turned in together and
    lose 10% for each day late.

**

**Course Description and Goals.** The course will examine a variety of issues
in the economic history of the United States. Several themes will be given
emphasis, including: the diversity of the U.S. population and the way
different groups have played different roles in the country's economic
development; the interaction between the state and the economy; the role of
education and technological change; the great material success of the U.S.
economy and the disruptions in that success; the interactions between social
conflict and economic change. The goals of the course are to introduce
students to some of the important factors that have shaped the historical
background for the current-day U.S. economy and to use the examination of
history to develop students' understanding of basic economic concepts.

**Pre-requisites.** Economics 101 and 102 or permission of the instructor. The
course assumes a basic general knowledge of U.S. history, at least what one
would obtain in a high-quality, high school U.S. history course.

**Requirements.** Your course grade will be based on class participation, two
in-class exams, a term paper, and a proposal for the term paper. Regarding the
way participation will affect your grade and regarding the nature of the term
paper and proposal (and penalties for lateness), see the notes at the end of
the syllabus. _If you fail to turn in your term paper proposal in a timely
manner (see notes at the end of the syllabus), you may be asked to withdraw
from the course._

  | _Date_ | _Share of Grade_  
---|---|---  
First in-class exam | Thursday, March 8 | 20%  
Term Paper Proposal | Due on Thursday, March 29 | 10%  
  
Second in-class exam  | Tuesday, April 24 | 25%  
Term Paper  | Due on Tuesday, May 15 | 45%  
  
**Readings.** Readings will come from a variety of sources. A good deal of the
reading will be from a text that will be available in the bookstore. This text
is _A New Economic View of American History_ , 2nd Edition, by Jeremy Atack
and Peter Passell (A&P).

**Office hours.** My office hours are 9:00 to 10:00 on Tuesday and Thursday. I
realize, however, that many people cannot meet me during my office hours. So
you can always call me or e-mail me (phone number and e-mail address above) or
catch me at class, and we can make an appointment. Also, I will usually be in
my office early in the afternoon on Tuesday and Thursday, and sometimes during
the middle of the day on Wednesday (as well as other random times during the
rest of the week).

**Note**. I do not accept papers or paper proposals by e-mail. You must supply
me with a hard copy.

**Schedule:** Not having taught this course before, I am not able to make
useful estimates of the times we will spend on each section. I will, however,
make a weekly announcement of where we are and where I expect us to go in the
coming days. Please try to stay ahead on the readings so that you can
contribute most effectively to class discussion.

CLASS PARTICIPATION

**

Because I want you to keep up on the readings and because I believe you learn
most effectively when you have to think through issues in class, I want to
involve you thoroughly in class discussion. Classes will include some
lectures, but I want you to take part actively in class discussions.
Accordingly, I will take your class participation into account when
determining your final grade. However, **class participation can only affect
your grade positively**. If, for example, you earn a  "B" on the basis of your
paper and exams but have demonstrated through class discussion an active
involvement with and understanding of the course material, your final grade
could be an "A". On the other hand, if, for example, you earn an "A" on the
basis of your paper and exams, you will receive an "A" even if you have said
nothing in class. Likewise, don't worry about saying things in class that
might be "wrong." Most often, they will not be wrong. In any case, they will
not hurt your grade. While I hope to rely largely on voluntary participation,
**I may call upon students to comment whether or not they volunteer** (but,
remember, you cannot hurt your grade by your responses).

**

LATE PAPER POLICY

**

A late term paper will be marked down one-third grade (e.g., from a "B+" to a
"B" or from a "B-" to a "C+") for each day it is late and a full grade for the
weekend. So, for example, a "B" paper turned in on Monday, May 21, will
receive a "D" (since the due date is the previous Tuesday, May 15). No papers
will be accepted after Friday, May 25. Please note: This policy may be
modified for good reason; a "good reason" can almost always be externally
verified (e.g., by a copy of a hospital bill).

Regarding your term paper proposal, it will be marked down by the same
procedure. **More important,** _if you fail to turn in your proposal by
Tuesday, April 3, it will probably not be accepted and you will probably be
required to withdraw from the course._ As with the term papers themselves,
this policy may be modified for good reason.

**

TERM PAPER

**

Your term paper will be due at the last class, Tuesday, May 15. The paper must
be at least 3,000 words in length, and must draw on several sources beyond the
course readings; the paper must be typed, double-space. It will count 45% of
your grade. I urge you to get started on your term paper as soon as possible;
doing so will make your life easier. Your paper topic must have my approval.
To obtain my approval, you must turn in a proposal including a page (several
paragraphs) explaining what you want to do, an outline, and a preliminary
bibliography. These proposals are due on March 29 (see above). Proposals will
be graded and will count 10% of your final course grade. I will give approval
to a wide range of topics, but here are some broad suggestions:

(1) You may take one of the many topics that we will deal with in the course,
and examine it more thoroughly. Or you might take an issue which we treat for
a particular period in the course and examine that same issue in another
period.

(2) You may choose another topic -- one of the many that I would like to deal
with more fully in the course if time permitted -- and examine some aspects of
that topic. Examples include the following:  
* the economic roles of native American peoples and their impacts on later U.S. economic development  
* controversies over water rights and their role in shaping U.S. economic development  
* anti-trust laws, reasons for their enactment, their impacts, and their social and political implications  
* the controversy over the profitability of slavery  
* the way the availability of land shaped the evolution of the U.S. economy at various stages  
* the effect of immigration and immigration policy on the U.S. economy in various periods  
* the impact of a particular war on the U.S. economy  
* the formation of unions at a particular point (e.g., during the 1930s) and their impact on subsequent economic change  
* the economics of the post-World War II "Golden Age"  
* the reasons for and impact of the gender structure of occupations (for instance, elementary school teaching)  
* the economic causes and impacts of Jim Crow   
* the causes and impacts of Chinese indentured labor in the U.S. west

(3) You may write an "extended review essay" based on a book that deals with
some significant aspect of U.S. economic history. By an "extended review
essay," I mean one that draws on several other sources, beyond the book that
is the focus of the essay, that ties the book to the larger issues of the
course, and that examines the central theses of the book critically and
thoroughly.

Again, whatever topic you select, you must submit a proposal (as described
above), and that proposal must have my approval for you to go ahead with the
topic.

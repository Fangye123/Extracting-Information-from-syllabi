### **COURSE DESCRIPTION  
  
The four-hour seminar in Literary Criticism has two closely allied goals: 1) a
close study of the HISTORY of literary commentary from Plato to the present;
2) a practical survey of contemporary CRITICAL THEORY AND APPROACHES. The
course provides students not only an understanding of the great tradition of
Literary Criticism but a chance to reflect on their own literary, pedagogical,
and critical interests.  
  

* The History of Literary Criticism: The study of the great tradition of critical commentary, beginning with Plato's attacks on poetry and ending with the writings of some important 20th critics, offers a history in miniature of literature and its sister arts thought the ages. All the big issues are raised: the ethical value of poetry; its impact--good and bad--on its various audiences; the relation of literature to science, philosophy, history and the other arts; high literary culture vs. low; the material base of aesthetic experience; gender and the question of the other--the list goes on. In this survey students also find some of the most memorable affirmations of the study of literature. You'll come to look at your selection of literature as a field of concentration in a whole new light.   
  

* Critical Approaches: Have you ever been perplexed (or perhaps delighted?) by coming across a particularly ingenious interpretation and wondering where in the world the teacher or writer came up with that reading? Welcome to the world of critical approaches, in which you'll study an impressive array of various schools of literary theory: scholarly; formalist; psychological; cultural; feminist; post-structuralist; hypertextual (lit. and the www). Our textbook does not just "theorize" about these approaches but applies them to clear readings of certain well-known, shorter literary works. You'll gain hands-on training in the practice of advanced literary interpretation and gain confidence in saying what you want to say. 

A SPECIAL EMPHASIS OF THIS SUMMER'S SEMINAR WILL BE ON LITERARY THEORY AND THE
HYPERTEXT, OR WAYS THAT THE WWW CAN HELP FACILITATE MORE FRUITFUL EXCHANGE
BETWEEN COLLEGES AND HIGH SCHOOLS, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. **

**GUIDELINES FOR THE ORAL REPORT**  
  

Each student will submit an outline and deliver a 20 minute oral report on a
specific critical approach or on a figure from the critical tradition. You can
choose any critic from the Richter anthology. Or you can consult the plentiful
references and bibliographies in the Oxford _Critical Approaches_ text (this
might be an especially good idea: as you read and become interested in a given
"approach," you could select a representative critic for further study). Or
you can choose a name from the list below (or see me if you have another idea
or choice):

Plotinus . . . Aquinas . . . St. Augustine . . . Dante . . . Ficino . . . Pico
. . . Corneille . . . Voltaire . . . Locke . . . Addison . . . Lessing . . .
De Stael . . . Barbauld . . . Blake . . . Schlegel . . . Hazlitt . . . Poe . .
. Schopenhauer . . . Emerson . . . Whitman . . . Hawthorne . . .Sainte-Beuve .
. . Taine . . . Nietzsche . . . Henry James . . . Bergson . . . Croce . . .
Dewey (I've omitted 20th C. critics because they're mentioned so extensively
in our class texts).

Each outline will be in three parts:

* I. Background information: don't overdo the biography; place the figure briefly in the historical and intellectual context of his or her time. Education, association with other formative critics or movements--info. of this kind. 
* Major critical formulations: the heart of you report. Drawing (quoting) from the text you've chosen, articulate _three or four_ of the critic's key ideas. 
* Influence/Contribution to the Tradition: Briefly in a paragraph assess the importance of the critic in terms of influence and place in the tradition. 

Each outline will also end with a Works Cited section. See my Plato report as
a sample outline.

What follows below are Steven Willet's criteria for great poetic art, art that
deserves high canonical status. Willet formulates these to contest the recent
insistence by some critics that many once neglected women poets of the
Romantic period should join the canon: although many have praised the poems of
a Mary Robinson, A. L. Barbauld, and Felicia Heamons, for example, Willet
argues they don't measure up to the criteria. His is something of an Arnoldian
argument but grounded in the classical (both western and eastern) rhetorical
tradition; it's anything but politically correct. See what you think:

I certainly do think there are some fairly simple, time-tested and true
principles for assessing poetry:

1\. Craftsmanship in versification over a wide range of genres;

2\. Exploitation of the poetic tradition as given to the poet;

3\. Verbal creativity in imagery, simile, metaphor and aural effects--the
"incarnadine" factor;

4\. Emotional intensity or, as Pseudo-Longinus has it, "hypsos" ("elevation");

5\. Broad range of stylistic registers;

7\. Deft use of semantic density and polysemy and/or

8\. Deft use of complex simplicity;

9\. Mastery of rhetoric;

10\. Avoidance of trite, simplistic and callow emotions;

11\. Ability to form aesthetic unity in diversity;

12\. Skill in fashioning what Liu Xie called concealed beauty;

13\. Memorability and inevitability of statement--"The best lack all
conviction" factor;

14\. Originality incremental (Wordsworth) or radical (Celan).

Great poets need not have all these, which are really just a narrow selection
I've chosen for ease of argument, but they must have a fair proportion of
them. Any poet who lacks Nos. 1, 3, 4, 13 and 14 is going to find himself far
out in the suburbs of Parnassus--if he's lucky.--Willet

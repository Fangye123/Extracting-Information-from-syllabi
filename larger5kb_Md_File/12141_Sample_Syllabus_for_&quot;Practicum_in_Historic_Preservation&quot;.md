>> **COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
>  The Practicum in Historic Preservation is a field based course, with most
of the work occurring outside of the classroom. The focus of the Spring 2000
class is on preparing an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER)
documentation of the McDonald Mills in McDonald, Ohio. Students will prepare a
narrative history, site plans, and photographs, all of which will be
permanently housed in the Library of Congress. Because of the nature of the
site, it is recommended that students wear appropriate boots and clothes.

>> **COURSE GOALS:**  
>  Students who successfully complete this course will:

>>

>>   * Develop the skills to prepare students for future internships and
employment as Historic Preservationists

>>   * Participate in creating an Historic American Engineering Record
documentation

>>   * Gain hands-on experience using archives and public records to research
the history of an industrial site

>>   * Learn the rudiments of large format photography

>>   * Gain an overview of the history of city and municipal reform movements
in the twentieth century

>>   * Develop analytical, writing, and verbal skills through class
discussion, reading, and the completion of the Historic American Engineering
Record

**NATURE AND AMOUNT OF STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY**  
>  The principle focus of our practicum effort this spring will be the
McDonald Mills in McDonald, Ohio. As a class our goal is create an Historic
American Engineering Record documentation of the site. To complete the overall
package and documentation, students will be divided into groups of 3 or 4 and
assigned specific tasks to be completed to HAER guidelines. Two separate
groups will be responsible for completing the documentation for the entire
complex. Each group will be responsible for completing either the historic
context or a description of the industrial process used at the plant. In
addition, these two groups will be responsible for developing the title page,
sources of information/bibliography, graphic documentation (key to buildings
and site plan), and index to photographs (key to photographs) portion of the
report for the overall complex. The three remaining groups will each be
responsible for completing the documentation on one of the three buildings on
site. Each report on a separate building includes a title page, narrative
(architectural description and historical narrative of the building, including
what it was originally used for and how it has changed), sources of
information/bibliography, graphic documentation, if any (layout plans,
historical sketches), index to photographs, and key to photographs.

>>

>> Students will be assigned to their respective research group during the
first week of class.

>>

>> The overall package, once edited by the historic preservation faculty, will
be submitted to the National Park Service for permanent inclusion to the
HABS/HAER collection in the Prints and Photographs collection of the Library
of Congress.

>>

>> **A preliminary copy** of each section of the HAER report is due in Week
Six of the quarter. This should be a rough draft that brings together what you
have found.   Remember, when putting your information together to follow HAER
guidelines. Make enough copies of the report to distribute to each person in
the class. I will critique my copy, grade it, and hand it back as soon as
possible.

>>

>> **Final reports** are due in Week Nine of the quarter. Final submissions
must include a hard copy and a computer disk.

>>

>> During Week Ten students will collaborate in pulling this material together
in create the Historic American Engineering Record documentation for the City
Water Works.  
>  
>>

>> **GETTING OUT IN THE FIELD**  
>  Much of our work will be conducted outside of the classroom at the City
Works. Pay close attention to the syllabus so that you will be at the right
place. When driving is required, you may either drive on your own or arrange a
car pool among classmates or team mates. Which ever you choose, make certain
that you arrive on site on time - because of time constraints to complete this
project, tardiness will not be tolerated.

>>

>> It is best if you could arrange your schedule on field work days that you
do not have other commitments immediately before 1:00 p.m. or immediately
after 3:00 p.m.  
>  
>>

>> **GRADES**  
>  There are no examinations in this course. Instead you will be graded on
your effort and accomplishment in your research and documentation projects,
and on your participation in the class as a whole.

>>

>> The course uses the standard 100 point grade scale in which A=90, B=80,
C=70, D=60, and F=59 or below.  Final grades will be computed as follows: |  |
Preliminary report  | 20%  
>> ---|---  
>> Final report  | 50%  
>> Class Participation  | 30%  
>> TOTAL | 100%  
>>  
>> **Graduate Credit**  
>  
>   Graduate Final Grades will be computed as follows: |  | Preliminary report
| 20%  
>> ---|---  
>> Final report  | 50%  
>> Review essay  | 10%  
>> Class Participation  | 20%  
>>  
>> **YOUNGSTOWN STATE UNIVERSITY POLICY ON INCOMPLETES**  
>  The University has instituted a new policy concerning incompletes. Any
incomplete not finished within one year, or upon graduation, will
automatically become an "F" on your permanent transcript.

>>

>> If you need extra help: If you are learning, sensory or physically
disabled, and feel that you require assistance in lectures or assignments,
please let me know during the first week of class. Discussions regarding such
assistance will be held in confidence.

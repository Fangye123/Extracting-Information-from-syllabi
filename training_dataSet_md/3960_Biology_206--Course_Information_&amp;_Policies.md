  * Sample exam questions will be posted. Review sessions before exams will be arranged.
  * Homework: There will be 4 problem sets and two writing assignments, which will add up to 50 points (10% of your grade) and assist you in preparing for exams. Homework should be handed in on time, or the grade will be reduced for each day it is late.

## Goals and Procedures

> A continuation of Biol/MBB 205, this course will begin with transmission
genetics including linkage, recombinational mapping, and chromosomal
aberrations, building to more complex topics including genomics, human gene
mapping, and developmental genetics. The second half of the course will use
the foundation already created to introduce the cellular and genetic basis of
development. Following a discussion of the fundamental principles that are
used recurringly in developing organisms, we will focus on the mechanisms
underlying animal development, beginning with gametogenesis and fertilization,
and proceeding through gastrulation and organogenesis. Pattern formation,
control of gene expression, cancer, and gene and cell therapy will be among
the topics discussed.

**Laboratory**

> Biol/MBB 216, the laboratory associated with Biol/MBB 206, is a very
important part of the course. Students must enroll for it separately, and are
graded separately on the lab component, but both address the same principles.
The hands-on, real organism experience will add to your understanding of the
same material you are learning in lectures and readings.

**Skills** :

  * critical reading
  * problem solving
  * integrating concepts
  * experimental design
  * biology literacy

## Requirements & Policies

> **1.** **Attendance.** This is highly recommended. We have noted in the past
a high correlation between regular attendance and successful completion of the
course. You are responsible for all of the material covered in lectures.

>

> **2.** **Homework** **.** **Doing the homework assignments is guaranteed to
very marginally help your grade (in aggregate, they account for 10% of your
grade). More importantly, they are designed to help prepare you for the exams
(which together account for 90% of your grade). Therefore we strenuously
encourage you not only to complete them but also to check the key, as this is
the best preparation you can have for the exams.**

>

> **3.** **Exams.** There will be four exams. All will be closed book. There
will be concepts to explain, problems to solve, and short essay questions.
Exams will focus on material discussed in class. We will post examples of exam
questions. The first three exams will be in-class, the fourth during finals
week.

>

>> Although each exam focuses on the most recent material, the course builds
on what you have already learned, and part of the fouth exam covers the entire
course. Therefore, you should have a good understanding of previous material
in the course. Go over the answer key after each exam, and review any sections
you have not mastered.

>

> **If you cannot take an exam for extenuating circumstances, you must talk
with your instructor -- if ill, we will need a doctor's note. Any other
reasons will need a note of explanation signed by the Dean's Office.**  
>

>

> _Regrade Policy:_ If you think an error has been made in grading or scoring
your exam, you may submit your exam, with written explanation of the error you
think was made, to the instructors  within seven days of the date it was
returned in class. Exams written in pencil cannot be regraded.

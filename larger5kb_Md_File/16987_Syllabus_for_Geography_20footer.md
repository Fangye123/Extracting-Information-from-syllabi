**     C. Other Evaluation**

  1. **  Participation in class discussion.**
  2. **  Participation in class activities.  This includes the submission of any written assignments on the due date.  _All_ written   assignments must be typed or printed from word processing software.  Proofread all work.  Documents longer than one page must be stapled to be accepted.**

**IV**. **_Course Procedure_**

    **A.   Attendance**

  1. **Read the official policy in the Undergraduate Catalog.**
  2. **I take attendance virtually every day because points are awarded for attendance and participation.**

**     B. Examinations**

  1. **The specific date for an exam will be announced as far in advance as possible.**
  2. **If you miss an exam, the make-up (if allowed) _must_ be taken during the designated make-up time.   No make-up exam will be given without proper documented evidence of any illness or any other reason for missing an exam.  This same requirement applies to all of the forms of evaluation in this course.**

**     C. Lecture Notes**

  1. **As usual, each student is responsible for all the materials discussed in class.**
  2. **Coherent lecture notes will be essential for your success in this course.   Use a system of note taking that will help you organize the information for study.  I will be pleased to provide suggestions on note taking for all those who  desire assistance.**
  3. **You will need to listen carefully in order to learn.   One-half of the responsibility for good communication in this class is yours.  Therefore, do pay close attention to the lecture using active learning strategies.   Do not talk, do not read other materials, and do not create distractions for those around you.  I accept my one-half of the responsibility, and it is to be clear in my statements and to allow you to contribute comments and/or opinions whenever appropriate.  Remember that listening skills are vital for learning _and_ for success in the academic as well as the working world.   Just a friendly reminder \- student participation should be in the form of university-level language, not dorm-speak or street-talk.**
  4. **A few other general guidelines for enhancing the learing environment are worth noting.   This class is only 50 minutes in length so there is no need for anyone to arrive late or leave early.  Both are disruptions, and so are cell phone so turn them off.  It is inappropriate for any one person to disrupt the learning of others.  Accept the responsibility to be prompt.  The class starts at 10:00 so there is no need to eat or drink.  Please have your breakfast before class.  Excessive chattering and gum cracking are also disruptive!  Disruption of any type will not be tolerated.**
  5. **In short, I want to create a learning environment that provides everyone with the opportunity to maximize his or her potential.   I thank you in advance for your cooperation.**

**     E. General Notes**

  1. **I am prepared to assist each one of you to do your best in this course.   I will answer questions before, during, and after class or during an office hour.  You can even send me an email message if a question comes to mind at 2 AM!    There is plenty of opportunity to have your question answered so feel free to ask.  This suggestion also applies to concerns other than this course.  For example, if you are uncertain about some University requirement, I will be happy to explain how it may affect you.  This is particularly important for those of you who are freshmen and/or transfer students.  A university can seem like a bewildering array of rules and regulations.  Come see me and I will help you separate the important from the trivial.  Let us have a super semester!**
  2. **For those of you who are undecided about a major or not certain that your current major is the right one, please feel free to come chat with me about the many and varied job opportunities for geography majors.   Perhaps some of  you are considering a minor program.  I will be pleased to show you how to complete the necessary paperwork to add an interesting geography minor.**

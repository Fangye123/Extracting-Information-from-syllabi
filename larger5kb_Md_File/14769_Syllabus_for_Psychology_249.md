In this class, we will be both studying and experiencing group dynamics and
group conflict. We will concentrate our attention on group conflict. But we
will spend some bit of time, particularly early on, in learning about group
process in small task oriented groups&emdash;the sort of groups in which you
will be working. A great deal of your time will be concentrated in applying
what we know about conflict resolution to the current negotiations over the
West Bank. More on this later.

Your grade will depend almost entirely on your groups success in negotiation
and analysis across the 3 negotations. Notice that I have reduced the emphasis
on the first negotiation analysis to allow you to get used to this format
without too large a penalty.

The projects involve researching the background and taking as a "client" one
of the parties in the negotiation over the West Bank. The project will be
completed in several stages: your first assignment will be to prepare a
"background briefing" for the class based on your research on your client.
Throughout the semester, you will be participating in "negotiation role play,"
where you will take the part of the parties you have studied. Each of these
role playing incidents will result in a journal and an analysis paper. Each
analysis paper will be due 1 week after your negotiation.

In addition, you will be asked to make a communication profile for yourself,
indicating your perceived strengths and weaknesses, and to keep a
communications journal that tracks your achievements, challenges, and
progress.

Please pay close attention to the documents on the negotiation process and to
the instructions for the journal and analysis paper. Since you will be working
in groups I will have high standards forthe quality of your papers.

# Reform, Revolution, Terror:  Russia, 1900-1939





                The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union are among the most important and influential events of the twentieth century.  Not surprisingly, almost every aspect of the Revolution and the emergence of the Soviet system has aroused intense controversy, from the origins of these events and processes, to their character and the forces driving them, to the nature and meaning of their outcome.  The purpose of this seminar is to enable students to explore the sources and process of revolution in early twentieth-century Russia and the controversies the Revolution continues to provoke through both common readings and a substantial independent research project.  Class meetings therefore will be devoted initially to the discussion of common readings intended to familiarize students with the main aspects and interpretations of the Revolution (defined broadly as the period from roughly 1900 to 1939), as well as with some of the sources on which these interpretations are based.  The last few weeks will be devoted to helping students with their research.  Topics for general discussion include the prospects for non-revolutionary change prior to 1914, the substance and significance of Marxist-Leninist ideology and Bolshevik political culture, the interplay of social, political, ideological, and cultural forces in shaping the revolution and the new Soviet order, the process of cultural revolution, and the origins and nature of Stalins revolution from above and the Great Terror of 1937-1939.  Research topics will be chosen by each student in consultation with the instructor and can concern any aspect of Russian history during the revolutionary era.



## BOOKS



The following books can be purchased at the Williams College Bookstore:



M. Malia, _The Soviet Tragedy_

S. Fitzpatrick, _The Russian Revolution_

R. Tucker, _Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia_

M. Lewin, _The Making of the Soviet System_

N. Harding, _Leninism_



In addition, a packet of photocopies should be obtained from the History
Department Secretary, Mrs. Swift (310 Stetson), for a charge that partially
covers reproduction costs.



## REQUIREMENTS



                Course requirements include thoughtful participation in each class (25% of the final grade), a final research paper (approximately 30 pp.) due by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 May (75% of the final grade), and an annotated bibliography in preparation for the research paper (due on Friday, 10 March, in the instructors box in Stetson;  the grade for this essay will be included in that for the research paper).



                The research paper may be on any topic related to the Russian Revolution, defined broadly, but the topic must be approved by the instructor.  The paper should define a clear thesis and support it using appropriate evidence, which should include a significant body of primary sources.  The paper also should discuss the historiography of the topic chosen and state the significance of the findings for our understanding of the Revolution.



                In addition, each student will be responsible for presenting an initial response to the secondary readings for one or two classes and to the primary source readings for another class.  __Response to secondary readings__ _:_   The secondary readings for each week will reflect the diversity of interpretations regarding a particular issue, for example the social versus the political character of the October Revolution, the relative role of social conflict, political ideology, and contingency in shaping the new Soviet state, and Stalins personal role and motives in initiating the policy of forced collectivization and the terror of the late 1930s.  I will provide a brief historiographical introduction at the beginning of each class.  One of the students will then offer a 10-15 minute response to the readings, summarizing briefly what he or she considers to be the main points at issue, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the arguments being made by the different authors, and his or her own conclusions from the readings.  The response does not need to be written out, but the student should at least have a comprehensive outline, which I will collect at the end of the class.  __Interpreting primary readings__ _:_   In the second part of each class, another student will offer a 10-minute or so evaluation of the primary source readings for the class, explaining how they can be used by historians to understand the particular period of Soviet history to which they relate and to help resolve the conflicts over interpretation revealed in the secondary readings. The evaluation does not need to be written out, but the student should at least have a comprehensive outline, which I will collect at the end of the class.

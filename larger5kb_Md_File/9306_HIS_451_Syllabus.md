**PURPOSE OF THE COURSE**

On the eve of a new millennium, this course covers British colonialism and
imperialism during the past four and a half centuries. Certain themes of broad
significance will be emphasized, including the variety of ways that different
cultures and civilizations were affected by the British from the sixteenth
through the eighteenth centuries and especially in the nineteenth century; the
growing importance that modern British arms, shipping, and trade played in the
nineteenth-century expansion of their empire; the ascendancy that British
wealth and power gained and lost in the twentieth century; and the pivotal
role that certain technologies, institutions, and ideas, including the English
language, have played in the global-wide processes of modernization. To
counter imperialistic, revisionist, and neo-romantic myths about the empire,
British colonists and imperialists of the past will be viewed within their
appropriate historical contexts so as to avoid judging the actions of the past
by the standards of today. British intentions and interests will be explored,
along with the short and long-term consequences that colonialism and
imperialism have had on various states and peoples throughout the world.

**GROUP PROJECTS ON BRITISH IMPERIAL LEGACY IN TWELVE REGIONS**  
Every undergraduate and graduate student in HIS 451 must participate in one
group project, the purpose of which is to consider the legacy of the British
Empire in twelve regions of the world, namely: Ireland, the West Indies and
Caribbean; Central and South America; North America; Australia/New Zealand;
Southern Africa; West and East Africa; the Indian Subcontinent; East Asia;
Southeast Asia; Egypt  & Sudan; Southwest Asia. Students should select which
regional group in which they wish to participate, with the size of the group
depending upon class enrollment.

**At the class meeting immediately before the day of the class discussion,**
the group members must distribute to the whole class photocopies of one map of
the region and a digest (typewritten, double-spaced, two-inch margins, stapled
top left) answering in two or three pages all of the following questions as
follows:

  1. What was the region like before the British came in terms of geography, demography, and culture. 
  2. When, how and why did the British overtake the region? 
  3. How did the British maintain their colonial or imperial rule? Direct rule? Indirect rule? Collaborators? Allies? 
  4. How were British colonial or imperial costs financed? What forms of taxation were used? Who bore most of this burden? 
  5. For what were revenues used? Local development? Regional needs? Imperial defense? 
  6. What were the assets/liabilities of the British from using their power in that region? Economic? Political? Strategic? Other? 
  7. What was the nature and extent of opposition to British rule? 
  8. When, how, and why did the British withdraw from or remain in that region? 
  9. Was the British impact on the peoples of that region socially, economically, politically, culturally benign or malign? 
  10. During decolonization since World War I, did the United States government step into British imperial shoes there?

**On the day of the group discussion,** the members of the group will be
panelists at the front of the classroom with Professor Adelson presiding as
moderator. Panelists will be expected to defend the digest and other questions
that he and students pose. All members of the group will receive the same
grade based on the quality of the group's written and oral presentations.

**Professor Adelson will distribute in early October a guide to resources in
the University Library and available on Internet that will assist students in
preparing their group projects.**

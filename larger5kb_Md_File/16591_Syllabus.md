History of Art and Architecture 11  
**LANDMARKS OF WORLD ARCHITECTURE**  
Fall 2000

**Professors:** Cherie Wendelken and members of the HAA faculty  
---  
**Lectures:** Tuesday and Thursday, 12pm, Sackler Museum Lecture Hall  
**Sections:** Weekly, to be arranged  
**Head TFs:** [Susan Merriam and Liz Ross](mailto:fa11@fas.harvard.edu)  
  
The purpose of this course is two-fold: (1) to introduce students to a select
group of significant monuments in world architecture from ancient times to the
present and the unique aesthetic, cultural, and historical issues that frame
them; and (2) to present the main issues in the study of architecture and the
various methods historians of art and architecture use to analyze and
interpret buildings.

The lectures, which draw upon the expertise of various members of the faculty,
will address a different culture or period each week, focusing on a single
building or complex chosen for its exemplary character. Sites will include
twentieth-century America; Edo Japan; the Baroque Court of Louis XIV; the
Batammaliba culture of Africa; medieval France; Imperial China; Byzantine
Constantinople; ancient Mesopotamia; Mughal India; Renaissance Italy; ancient
Greece; and nineteenth-century and contemporary Paris.

The sections will consider the multiple factors involved in the design and
creation of buildings and how they affect our experience and understanding of
their architecture. Beginning at the simplest level of learning how to read
architectural drawings, sections will move on to increasingly complex subjects
such as the role of program and client, the social and political aspects of
architecture, and a consideration of architecture in the urban context.
Sections and lectures have been coordinated, and readings chosen, to allow for
weekly discussions to move from the specific historical context at hand to the
more general architectural questions it raises.

**Required Readings:**

A sourcebook will be available for sale at the Science Center and on reserve
at the Fine Arts, Hilles, and Lamont Libraries. Due to circumstances genuinely
beyond our control, the sourcebook is not yet available. You will be notified
in lecture and via e-mail when it becomes available.

In addition, there are two required books on order at the Coop. The first is
not yet available; we will let you know when it arrives. The second is ready
for purchase.

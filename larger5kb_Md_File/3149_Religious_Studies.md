not providing proper documentation of your written, visual or aural source.
Give credit to the sources you use in your writing. The penalty for plagiarism

penalty for cheating will likewise be an F for the course. (Further action may
be instituted by the Department and the University.) See Guidelines for
Academic writing in Religious Studies on my Webpage if you are unfamiliar with
MLA documentation. Other forms of documentation are also permitted. Check with
me first.  
>  **Mutual Respect** is expected as we explore diverse religious traditions.
You may not agree with your professor or fellow students, but please extend
all the courtesy of acknowledging their ideas.

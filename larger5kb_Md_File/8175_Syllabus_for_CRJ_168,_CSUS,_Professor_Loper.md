**Goals For This Class**

> By learning the basic purposes of communication, theories of communication,
a few specific examples of communication technology, and the types of data
used in the criminal justice and public safety systems, you will have the
basis for understanding new communications standards and implementations of
technology in the future.

**Expected Learning Outcomes**

> With the successful completion of this course, you should be able to
accomplish these tasks:  
> 1\. Demonstrate a basic competency with written and spoken communication.  
> 2\. Distinguish between the purposes of communication.  
> 3\. Identify appropriate media for communication.  
> 4\. Model complex communication systems.  
> 5\. Demonstrate familiarity with various communications media.  
> 6\. Demonstrate a basic understanding of information structures.  
> 7\. Outline existing law enforcement communications networks.

**Grading** The course grade will be determined as follows:

  3 Exams | 75%  
---|---  
  5 Assignments | 25%  
  
The course grade will be reported as follows:

  93% to 100% | A |   73% to 76% | C  
---|---|---|---  
  90% to 92% | A- |   70% to 72% | C-  
  87% to 89% | B+ |   67% to 69% | D+  
  83% to 86% | B |   63% to 66% | D  
  80% to 82% | B- |   60% to 62% | D-  
  77% to 79% | C+ |   All Others | F  
  
Borderline grades will be reported in their proper category (i.e. an 89% is a
B+). However, I will round numbers where it is appropriate (i.e. an 89.4% is a
B+, but an 89.5 is an A-).

The formula for grading is not a contract. If it benefits the objectives of
this course to change the grading criteria, they will be changed and notice
will be given to the class. **Exam** Any information presented in class, in
the readings, or in the assignments is available for the exams. Exams will be
in an _objective format_ and _short answer format_.

A make up exam (after the fact) will only be given under extreme circumstances
with written verification of reason. An alternative exam may be granted under
liberal conditions given _prior_ arrangement with me. Prior arrangement must
be at least one week in advance of the exam date. If you know that you will
not be able to attend the scheduled exam, contact me as soon as possible. A
make-up/alternative exam may be given in any format (essay etc.). **Minor
Assignments** Assignments are designed to reinforce material presented in
class or in the readings. Each work product should be unique to the student
that created it (unless group work is assigned). Assignments may also include
in-class exercises with a home preparation component. A detailed description
of each is available through the class webpage under
[assignments](crj168_assignments.htm).

Late assignments are unacceptable without prior arrangement. **Attendance &
Participation** Attendance is not mandatory, but the due dates of assignments,
possible unannounced quizzes, and exams still apply. Students are solely
responsible for information or class format changes made during their absence.



  **Other Administrivia**

> Your integrity is assumed.

>

> Students with cellular phones, alarm wrist watches, audible beepers, or
other electronic equipment must render them inaudible during class.

>

> Students who intend to miss class for religious observances not acknowledged
in the normal University holidays must contact me at the beginning of the
semester.

>

> Students with learning disabilities or physical disabilities are encouraged
to contact me at the beginning of the semester so accommodations can be made
as soon as possible. For more information see
<http://www.csus.edu/sswd/sswd.html>.

> Get the names and E-mail addresses of at least two people in the class:

  
**Class Time Line** Please note, this time-line may change at any time that I
see the need. Also note, exam times will not move forward. Notification of
changes will occur in class or as I see fit.  **Sect.1** | **Sect. 2** |

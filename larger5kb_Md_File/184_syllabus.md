_**Exams: ** _

There will be two exams--a midterm and a final.  The exams will be short essay
and fill-in-the blanks.

_**Papers: ** _

There are two options, described below, and each student should identify which
option they have chosen by Week 5 (the first short paper is due at the end of
Week 6).

**_Option 1:_   **Write three short (3-5 page) papers--each on a different
topic related to perspectives covered in class.  The purpose of each paper is
to explore one of the concepts discussed in class in more depth.  The paper
should identify the basic concept, explain the strengths and weaknesses of the
concept, identify adherents to the concept and discuss how this perspective
has already, or might in the future, affect policies related to environmental
issues.  

_**Option 2:**_   Write one long (9-15 page) paper which presents the history
and philosophy of a single environmental group (for example Earth First,
Greenpeace, any of the Wise Use groups).  The paper should include a
discussion of who founded the group, who the leaders are, why the group
exists, what the group does, how large it is, and whether its actions are of a
local, regional or national nature.  In particular the paper should attempt to
identify the perspective(s) discussed in class which is (are) most strongly
related to the group discussed.

**Format:** All papers should be double-spaced with 1 " margins and use normal
(not extra large) font size.  The papers should have an Introduction detailing
the issue or topic to be discussed, a Discussion of the topic _in the students
own words_ and a Summary.   The student should _cite references_ within the
text and include a Literature Cited section (format to be provided) at the end
of the paper.   The papers should be concise and well organized.  The student
should spell-check and proof-read each paper.  There will be two scores given
for each paper: one for content (90%) and one for organization, grammar,
spelling, etc. (10%).  

_**Notebooks: ** _

The notebooks should record vocabulary words used during the course (including
definitions) and a short (1-2 pages, handwritten) entry describing the
students concept of each major topic covered in lectures.

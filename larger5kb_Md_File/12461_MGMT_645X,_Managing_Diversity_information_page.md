This upper level course combines social justice and change management studies.
It encourages leaders and managers to examine their behavior and that of their
peers, colleagues and subordinates in order to transform organizational
superior/subordinate relationships. Human resources practices that support the
status quo will be considered in light of discrimination on the basis of race,
gender, faith affiliation, sexual preference, ability and class.

**Learning Outcomes**  
---  
  
This course will empower learners to:

  1. Examine their own role in dominant/subordinate relationships,
  2. Identify negative behavior around differences interacting one-to-one, in groups and on the organization level,  

  3. Map power alliances based on group identities,  

  4. Reflect and share at the affective level in order to improve responses to subordinate group members' experience,  

  5. Employ both/and thinking to unlock the either/or viewpoints of dominant and subordinate groups,  

  6. Compose a strategy to address the powerful in order to minimize bias and maximize organizational effectiveness.

**CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE**

> This interactive web-based course utilizes two face-to-face (f2f) sessions
in order to help learners to distinguish multiple realities as perceived by
individuals experiencing the same event, develop their professional capacity
for organization transformation by examining policies, practices and systems
for bias, integrate strategies to overcome denial and distance from the source
of diversity problems, and locate resources for continuing diversity education
and lifelong learning. The bulk of the coursework is delivered through our
texts and will be applied to current events utilizing DiversityInc.com, the
trade magazine for diversity. A reflective learning log will be kept. Class
discussions and sharing the best of our Learning Logs constitutes our primary
interactive means of expression.

questions, discuss the material using the vocabulary of the course, take an
active part in class discussions, and sharing from your Learning Log. At a
minimum, you should expect to contribute two thoughtful comments during the
course of a Module. This would be considered Acceptable (C) work. You do not
have to agree with everything in the course. However you may need to stretch
beyond your comfort zone to understand particular readings. To the extent you
are willing to do this, engaging your emotional self in addition to your task
oriented self, learning will increase.

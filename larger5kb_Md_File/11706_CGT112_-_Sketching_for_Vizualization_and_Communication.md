You are a graphic specialist for a marketing research firm named _Flim, Flam
and Howe_. There are 9 graphics people that work with and for you. The firm
specializes in obtaining reliable consumer related data about automobiles.
Under a current contract, the firm is developing strategies to provide a
manufacturer with information that will help guide future automobile design
efforts.

Francine, a vice president and research specialists within the firm, contends
that automobile front ends are actually passive displays of human facial
characteristics. The postulate is that it would be beneficial to provide proof
of existing designs relationships to human features, characterize desirable
human facial traits and propose a new design strategy based on this
philosophy. She believes that a quick analysis of existing automobiles could
provide important preliminary information to help further the project.
Therefore, the following memo was sent to you this morning.

MEMO

Date: 9-2-96

To: _______________________

(Graphic Specialist)

From: Francine

I need samples of automobile front ends, rear ends, dash boards, etc. for my
current project. Nothing fancy. I just need some sketches to share with the
project team to verify that what we believe about cars and facial
characteristics has some validity. Maybe some "straight-on" views of grills,
headlights, etc. would be all that we need. Approximately 7-8 sketches or so
would be great!

As usual, we needed it yesterday. The boss said for me to tell you to drop
whatever you are doing and give this the highest priority. She also said to
use as many of your people as necessary to "...turn this thing around
A.S.A.P."

Let me know if you need more information. I'll be out of town tomorrow, so fax
me the stuff at my hotel.

THANKS!

You are required to

  * sketch one orthographic view of the front, etc. of an automobile. (Include make, model and year.) 
  * submit your sketch as 1 of 8+/- sketches needed to create a document of automobile front ends. 
  * identify document standards. Require all members of your group to use the same lettering font, layout and line weight. 
  * prepare a fax cover sheet

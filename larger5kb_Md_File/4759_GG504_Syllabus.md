##  GG 504 - Physical Climatology

##  Spring 1998

_In this course we will study the physical principles that govern the climate
system and the spatial and temporal patterns of weather elements that occur on
regional and global scales. Topics to be covered include the physics of
climate, the mean observed state of the atmosphere, climate feedback
processes, climate change, and climatological data analysis methods._

Textbook: The textbook for this course is:

recommended, especially for graduate students:  
    
                 _Peixoto, J.P., and A.H. Oort, Physics of Climate , New York: American Inst. Physics, 520 pp., 1992._   


##  Grading

Exam 1 (midterm): 35%, Exam 2 (final): 35%, project: 30%.

No curves are used to adjust distributions. Exams are take-home and open-book,
done individually within 24 hours. Late exams are penalized 5% per hour. The
project topic and scope are up to you; it may involve a review of the
literature, data analysis, and/or model use (see page 3).  


##  Policies

  1. All exams must be taken at the scheduled times. Makeup exams are only given with a doctors note or a note from the Dean. No exceptions. 
  2. If you miss a class, do not ask to have the lecture material repeated during office hours. 
  3. Exam and final grades will be posted by social security number unless I receive, in writing, an alternative code from you. 
  4. See the college policies about academic honesty and incomplete grades. 

The following schedule will be adjusted to best suit needs of this particular
class. Chapters listed in the Reading column refer to the Hartmann book.

##  Semester Project Description

###  Project Type and Scope

Here are a few examples of acceptable project type and scope:

  * Describe and use a particular type of model; e.g., radiative-convective. Give examples of how this type of model has been used in climate research, and use it to explore a particular problem. (I have code for some models.) 
  * Research a particular climate feature like the Arizona monsoon, or a set of features unique to a particular geographic region such as the tropics or polar regions. An extensive literature search will undoubtedly be necessary. 
  * Analyze data from a meteorological station or analyze GCM or other model output. Compile statistics (time and/or space) for one or more variables. Examine trends if the time series is long, look at relationships between variables (e.g., surface skin and air temperatures). 

The possibilities are limitless. Be creative!

###  Notes

  1. The project is worth 30% of your final grade. This means that approximately one-third of the time you devote to this class should be spent on the project. Don't put it off! 
  2. A 3 minute presentation of your project is required, to be given during the last class.  With only 3 minutes all you can do is briefly describe the topic and present highlights of your results. 
  3. A typed project paper on the order of 15-30 pages is required.

**COURSE OVERVIEW**  

     This course will provide an introduction to U.S. history since the late 19th century. We will pay particular attention to labor and class conflict, race and ethnicity, and the evolution of the federal government as we explore the history of industrialization, the state of the American political economy, and the broad outlines of the American experience over the last hundred years.  

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**  

     Regular attendance at lectures and discussion sections, full preparation, and participation are expected. Written requirements consist of three 4-6 page essays, due April 24, May 15, and June 13, respectively. Topics for these essays will be handed out in lecture approximately one week before they are due. Essays will be graded on their strength of argumentation, use of evidence, and clarity of organization and expression.   

     Each of the essays is worth 20% of your grade. The penalty for late papers is one-third of a grade (i.e. A to A-, B+ to B, etc.) per day or fraction thereof; no excuses other than severe emergencies will be accepted. Throughout the quarter four pop quizzes will be administered in discussion sections. Together, the quizzes are worth 10% of your final grade. The remaining 30% of your grade will be based on your attendance and participation in section. If you attend sections regularly, you will receive at least a C+ for your section grade; a higher grade will depend on your teaching assistant's evaluation of your preparation and participation in class discussions. Unless you make alternative arrangements _in advance_ with your TA, you will receive a reduction of one-third of a grade for each discussion section that you miss.  

**TEXTS:**

     Most readings will be drawn from the texts listed below, which are available on reserve at the College Library. They may also be purchased at the bookstore in Ackerman Union.

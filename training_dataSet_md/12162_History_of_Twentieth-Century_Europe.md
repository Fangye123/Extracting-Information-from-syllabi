**History of Twentieth-Century Europe**

** [Final Grades](grades.html)**

  
  
  

At the beginning of the 20th century Europe was at the height of its political
and economic power, as well as in the midst of profound social and cultural
change. The democratic and industrial revolutions of the late 18th century had
by 1900 radically altered the conditions of life for the mass of the European
population. Industrial production had created the world's first consumer
societies, and while aristocratic elites still largely controlled the European
states, mass opinion and democratic demands strongly influenced political
decisions. Competing economic theories were marshaled to support worker and
capitalist visions of a just society, while movements for women's emancipation
pressed for greater access to political and economic power. From standards of
representation in art to theories of the mind, previous intellectual
certainties were called into question and fiercely debated. While Japan and
the United States had shown that states outside of Europe could master the new
industrial and military technology, the European powers had an overwhelming
advantage in these areas, as their successful imperialist expansions in the
late 19th century made evident.

Yet the situation within Europe was far from stable, and many of the economic,
political, and social forces that contributed to Europe's rise to world power
were also responsible for its near destruction by the mid-point of the
century. The European powers were dominant in 1900, yet for most of the last
fifty years of the 20th century they remained hostage to competing Cold War
armies, and were forced to relinquish their world empires. Even so, Europe
managed to regain its prosperity and its political autonomy in the decades
after World War II, reinventing many aspects of its political, social, and
economic institutions in ways that have proved more durable and lasting than
those based on the unbridled national competition that was the hallmark of the
first half of the 20th century.

The story of Europe's rise, destruction, and reconstruction over the last
hundred years is the focus of this course.  


\- **Grading** -  
Attendance and Discussion Participation \- 15%  
Reaction Papers - 40%  
Final Exam - 45%  


\- **Attendance and Discussion Participation** -  
A sign-in sheet will be passed around for each class meeting. Because there
are only nine class meetings available for lecture and discussion, after the
first unexcused absence your grade may be effected. Please discuss any
potential schedule problems with me before they arise. All students are
expected to participate in discussions, and come to class with questions
formulated in the process of writing the reaction papers.  


\- **Reaction Papers** -  
Each student will be required to write a reaction paper for each of the four
primary source works used in the class. Reaction papers should demonstrate a
knowledge of the book, but they should not simply be a summary of its
contents. In these papers you should relate the material in the book to the
themes of the course found in the textbook, the lectures, and/or the films.
The process of writing these papers is meant to prepare students for the class
discussion of the primary source works, and part of this preparation includes
formulating two questsions that can be asked within class discussion. Papers
should be between two and three pages.

\- **Final Exam** -  
The final exam will consist of identifications and essay questions.
Identification terms  will be drawn from the key terms listed on the outline
for each lecture. You will have a choice of essay questions, each of which
will require you to discuss broad themes within the material. Reviews of
potential essay themes will addressed in discussions.

#  Syllabus and Reading List

Updated 10/14/99 4:56 p.m.

##  Method of reading and taking notes

Readings should be done regularly. They are marked with the book symbol
![](book.gif). The reading assignments should be completed up to but not
beyond the week indicated for discussion that week. By the beginning of week
_x_ , you should have completed all assignments before the **WEEK _x_**
indicator seen on the left of the page.

Readings on reserve are marked "( **reserve** )". To save students time coming
into the library. I will color the "reserve" mark **red** if the reading is
not yet ready and **green** when it is ready. There should be three copies
available for people to read.

The items that are beyond the coming week mark may be changed as the syllabus
is not yet complete. Look at the date of the update above to see if you have
read the latest version.

After some of the readings there are comments, marked with a ? , that we may
take up in class as possible interpretations of the data. You do not have to
be able to answer the questions in the comments, but you should be able to
discuss the subject.

##  Archaeological research methods applied to Mesoamerica

Evaluate the different approaches to archaeology that have been taken at
different periods of time.

###  Early discoveries of the ancient civilizations

![](book.gif) Stephens, John L. (1841) Chapter 17 _In_ Incidents of Travel in
Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan. Vol 2, Pp. 289-307. New York: Dover.
(reserve)  
![](book.gif) Stephens, John L. (1841) Chapter 18 _In_ Incidents of Travel in
Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan. Vol 2, Pp. 308-324. New York: Dover.
(reserve)

? Did Stephens show respect for the discoveries that were made? What was the
basic goal of archaeological exploration in his time? Can we say that
archaeology existed in 1850?

###  Popular reaction and fantastical interpretations of the ancient
civilizations.

![](book.gif) Von Daniken, Erich (1970) Chapter 9, The Mysteries of South
America and Other Oddities. _In_ Chariots of the Gods. Pp. 97-107. New York:
Bantam.( reserve)

? Note the methods used by this pseudo-archaeologist. Note how the reader is
convinced of the truth of what is claimed. Archaeology is scientific. Its
conclusions are based on observations of material things. These material
things must be available for examination by anyone, or the reports of their
existence must be unimpeachable. Inferences, a type of theory in archaeology,
must be falsifiable by observation of these material things. Inferences must
be compatible with all that is archaeologically known about the culture.? How
well is the Chariot theory proven?

**WEEK 2** \- 9/14

###  The difference between the true pre-history of Mesoamerica and
fantastical interpretations

![](book.gif) Picture and drawing of the sarcophagus lid in the tomb of the
Temple of Inscriptions. Look at the details of this piece of sculpture. Do you
see what von Daniken sees? Go to the Maya resources for clues to the meaning
of the symbols. Parts of Linda Schele's analysis should be read when it
becomes available in the library.

>  History has long been the captive of the nation-state. As J.G.A. Pocock has
written,  "historiography originates as the memory of the state and develops
as the critical study of the processes that have brought the state int being."
Historians have thus until quite recently focused most of their attention on
the activities of the state; war, diplomacy, politics, administration, and
government. Even today, when the subject matter of history has expanded far
beyond this original conception, the vast majority of historians still make
the nation-state the essential, often unquestioned framework of analysis.

> This course is organized as a challenge to nationalist histories. Taking the
north Atlantic as its point of reference, it seeks to connect and combine the
various and hitherto artifically separated histories of Europe, Africa, North
America, and the Caribbean, and to demonstrate how the most important
processes of change can be understood only thourgh the international frame of
reference.

>

> The course is designed to introduce students to work in Atlantic history
both old and new, ranging from R.R. Palmer's The Age of the Democratic
Revolution, which provided soem of the intellectual underpinnings of NATO and
the alliance of the west during the Cold War, to newer scholarship that
approaches the Atlantic world "from the bottom up," from the perspective of
social history. We shall link the four corners of the north Atlantic in order
to study the movement of peoples, cultures, politics, and ideas in a broader,
more illuminating context. Our emphasis will be on the popular classes -- on
craftsmen and women, apprentices, wage laborers, sailors, indentured servants,
slaves, farmers, peasants, cottagers, villagers, domestics, and vagabonds, of
both genders and of many races, ethnicities, and nationalities. We shall study
how the activation of these masses of people during the Atlantic's age of
revolution changed global politics in decisive, irreversible ways. We shall
seek to discover connections within the muticultural experiences and histories
of working people, most of which have been either denied or ignored by
historians. In doing all this and more, we shall try to build upon and extend
the specializations and interests of members of the class.

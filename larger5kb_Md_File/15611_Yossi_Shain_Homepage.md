**Course Schedule**

**Fall 2002:  
**_GOVT 409 Department Seminar: Ethnicity Religion & Nationalism_ (Syllabus)  
This class will examine from a broad theoretical and empirical perspective the
evolution of states and communities in the Middle East, and the challenges
they face. To what extent have the modern concepts and institutions of
sovereignty and the rule of law penetrated Middle Eastern states? What has
been the role of national movements and ideologies in consolidating, or in
challenging, state boundaries? (great and narrow nationalism, pan- vs.
parochial Arabism). How have ethnic minorities responded to the quest for
state unity and national loyalty, and to what extent have their own
idiosyncrasies been recognized or denied? Finally, what is the role of Islam
in legitimating state power, or alternatively, in undermining the state system
through the rallying of religious communities under the banner of the "umma".
These questions will be examined in the context of the experiences of modern
Turkey, post-colonial Lebanon and Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Iran.

_GOVT 444 The Arab-Israeli Conflict_ (Syllabus)  
This survey class will introduce students to multifaceted dimensions of the
conflict-security issues, conflicting national and religious claims, competing
ideologies, social movements, international relations, peace making and
conflict resolution. We will examine systematically the development and
progression of the Arab-Israeli conflict, from the early days of Zionism to
contemporary attempts to reach a final settlement. The discussion will focus
on the following issues: The legacies of colonialism -Zionism and Palestinian
Arabs under the British mandate; the emergence of the state of Israel; the
Palestinian refugee problem; the role of Jordan; the PLO; repercussions of the
Six Day War; through Madrid, to Oslo, the emergence of the Palestinian
National Authority, and beyond.

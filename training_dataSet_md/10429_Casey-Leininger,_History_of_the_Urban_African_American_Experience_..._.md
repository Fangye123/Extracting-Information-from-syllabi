_Professor Casey-Leininger comments:  
This course is taught in one weekend, Friday evening through late Sunday
afternoon, with significant pre- and post class independent work done by the
students. In addition to class discussion, brief lectures, and videos, the
class has two field trips that explore Cincinnati's first ghetto and its
evolution and its much more massive post-World War II ghetto.  
  
Enrollment is limited to juniors and seniors with 3.0 grade point average._

## SYLLABUS

### INTRODUCTION

The racial isolation and concentrated poverty of decaying slum-ghettos in
American cities have become one of the most visible signs of the failure of
American society to deal with our nation's persisting racism. There is also a
larger and more successful black middle-class than at any time in American
history, but largely living separate lives from the white middle-class except
during the work day. This course will examine the complex interactions that
have resulted in this situation including public policy choices, private
choices made by millions of whites, and the desires of Black Americans for
self determination.  
  
The course will begin about 1900, when distinct African American ghettos began
to emerge in American cities as blacks began leaving the rural south in large
numbers for cities throughout the country, but particularly for northern
cities - the "Great Migration." It will end at about 1980 by which time
massive inner-city slum ghettos ("Second Ghettos") surrounded by more affluent
white communities had solidified and the post-Civil Rights black middle-class
had emerged.  
  
  

### COURSE PRE-REQUISITES

Eng. 103 or permission of instructor. All weekend courses offered through the
Adult Scholars Accelerated Program (ASAP) require that the students enrolled
have a strong academic record in order to assure that students can undertake
the rigors of significant independent study as well as the intensity of the
weekend experience itself. General knowledge of American history, including
especially, African American history will be helpful, but all students capable
of and willing to do serious academic work will find the course useful.

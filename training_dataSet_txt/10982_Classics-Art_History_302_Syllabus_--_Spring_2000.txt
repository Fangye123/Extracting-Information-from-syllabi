A Handbook of Roman Art, Cornell.Mortimer Wheeler, Roman Art and Architecture, Praeger.  RATIONALE STATEMENT - CLASSICS-ART HISTORY 302: Roman art is one of the traditional divisions into which scholarshipdivides the larger category of artifacts created by the humanrace which it has designated as visual art. We will begin thiscourse by examining the likely possibility that such a divisionis prejudicially effected by applying political boundaries toartistic endeavor. We will see that "Roman art," infact, includes the artistic production of many cultures over aperiod of over one thousand years only loosely tied together underthe aegis of "imperium Romanum," and that Etruscan,Hellenistic, Hebrew, Egyptian, Punic, and other artistic productionsall work together to create an amalgamated style which we call"Roman." We will proceed to a discussion of what is"Roman" about Roman art, looking for those featureswhich make of this amalgam one entity, thereby validating thescholarly designation. In so doing it will be necessary to examinethe various threads of the lengthy scholarly discussion whichhas defined the subject as traditionally promulgated. In our discussionwe will explore the likelihood that the specific content of whatwe think and say about the subject is a construct of scholarlyspeculation rather than an absolute.   Once we have established the existenceof Roman art as a scholarly theory, we will examine the "influences"of the two most pervasive (Etruscan and Greek) of the artisticcurrents which are subsumed within our traditional view. We willthen proceed to a study of the genre divisions by which scholarshave systematized the subject of Roman art, and explore how individualexamples fit into that systemization through a study of theirforms, traditions, meanings, and historical contexts.  In the process, students will experience Roman art directly throughtwo projects: (1) The examination and analysis of Roman art objectsin the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and (2) through their personalcreation of one of the artistic products outlined later in thissyllabus under "project two." In these projects, studentswill be able to investigate and interpret original works of Romanart, and actually experience the creation of an artistic product. As a result of our study of Roman art, students should understandthat people are as profoundly influenced by the visual world aroundthem as they are by the ideas which they store in their minds.They will further understand that a scholarly evaluation and analysisof that visual world is a necessary component of sophisticatedappreciation.  OBJECTIVES OF COURSE:  (1) to attempt to determine what we mean when we speak of Romanart, and to become familiar with the principal forces and influenceswhich produced and underlie it, (2) to understand the artisticdevelopment and purpose of the principal genres of Roman art,(3) to understand some of the techniques by which Roman art wasproduced, and by which it has been reclaimed and is displayed,(4) to understand the importance of a knowledge of the visualremains of past civilizations (particularly Roman) for our societyand the consequent value of art history and archaeology, and (5)to assimilate the materials and information necessary to recognizethe contributions of Roman art to the world around us.  TOPICS TO BE COVERED INCLUDE  I. The Geography and Topography of  the Roman world. II. The controversial nature of the  term "Roman" in "Roman art." II. The artistic background to Roman  art.  A. Greek art B. Etruscan art  III. Roman architecture - aulic and  provincial IV. Roman Sculpture  A. numismatics and portraiture B. historic relief  V. Roman painting  ATTENDANCE POLICY: Each student is expected to attend all classes. More than 3 absencesmay result in the lowering of a student's grade. Project and reviewdeadlines must be observed (late work discounted at one gradeincrement per day late). Students will be excused from classesdue to religious obligations and observances.   EVALUATION:  project no. 1 - 20%; test no. 1 - 20%; test no. 2 - 30%; project no. 2 - 30%  PROJECT NO. 1:  An analysis of Roman artifacts housed  in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts or another appropriate museum. PROJECT NO. 2:  You must select one of the following: 1. Through a study of Etruscan fresco  painting, it is possible to reconstruct Etruscan ritual dancing.  Using the laser disc hypercard program, De Italia, housed  in the Classics Department's computer lab in North Court 214,  collect examples of scenes which depict Etruscan dancing. Create  a hypercard stack of your collection. Carefully study your evidence  to determine how you will create such dances in actual performance.  Your final project will be a showing of your collected examples,  and your performance in which you recreate an Etruscan ritual  dance.    2. From representative scenes of Roman comedy depicted in Roman  frescoes and mosaics, and on the painted pottery of Southern  Italy we are able to reconstruct the theatrical costumes worn  by actors in Roman productions of the plays of Plautus and Terence.  Using the laser disc hypercard program De Italia, collect  examples of such art objects. Save your examples as a hypercard  stack. Then produce a series of watercolor sketches in which  you design costumes for the characters of Euclio, Megadorus,  Eunomia, and Lyconides in Plautus' comedy, Aulularia (Pot  of Gold). You can read the play in English translation in Boatwright  Library and watch scenes from a production of the play on the  World Wide Web at http://hermes@richmond.edu, the UR Department  of Classical Studies World Wide Web site.   3. Mosaic and tile work is one of Rome's most important and pervasive  art forms. The earliest such mosaics were made from pebbles,  naturally smoothed in stream and river beds, embedded in cement,  and were used for the flooring of Hellenistic and Roman buildings.  Such "pebble mosaics" are still widely created in the  Mediterranean today. Although we will discuss the creation of  mosaics in class, you will need to further explore through your  research how the work was done. Then create a small mosaic of  this "pebble" type using a design of your own creation.   4. Architectural photography demands the artistic ability to  recapture the form and line of buildings on film. Study examples  of architectural photography on the World Wide Web. Then study  Richard Cheek's excellent book of photographs of the architecture  of the University of Richmond, available in the UR bookstore. Using the ideas you learn from your  study, produce a portfolio (or your own world wide web site)  of architectural photographs of selected Roman Revival buildings.  (If you want tocreate a www site, your photographs can be optically  scanned in UR's computer center in Jepson Hall or in the computer  center located in the Department of Classical Studies - North  Court 214.)    Your portfolio should include both general and detailed views  of the Virginia State Capitol Building, the Science Museum of  Virginia, St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and the old Second Baptist  Church, now part of the Jefferson Hotel property. Or, if you  prefer, you can travel to Charlottesville, Va. and photograph  the buildings of Jefferson's original academic village, one of  the most outstanding examples of Roman Revival architecture in  the world.    Explain your photographs in an essay in which you describe the  processes and techniques you learned and used in producing your  portfolio.   5. The Romans were masters in the art of sculpted portraiture,  capturing the essence of the appearance and personality of a  particular human being. Over a period of time the Romans developed  three styles of representation by which they accomplished the  various purposes of different kinds of portraits - idealistic,  in which the subject was presented as he or she would appear  with all flaws removed ; realistic, in which the subject was  presented as he or she actually appears, and sympathetic, in  which the inner motivations of the daily stress of human life  appears as a focus of the subject portrayed. Today rather than  sculpture, the favored medium for portraiture is photography.  But the three styles developed by the Romans can still be applied.   Your job is to produce a photographic portfolio of portraits  using these three styles. Each subject you choose should be photographed  in each of the three styles so that comparative value and effect  can be clearly seen.    Accompany your portfolio with a short written analysis in which  you describe the techniques you discover in your use of the camera  to create the effects demanded for these three styles.

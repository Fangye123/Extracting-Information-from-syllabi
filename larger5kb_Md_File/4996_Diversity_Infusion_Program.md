_Official Course Description:_

This course will have a specific focus on diversity and the curriculum. This
is part of the Maricopa County Community College District's commitment to
diversity in its instructions. As part of the district's committee on
diversity and formally a member of the GCC diversity committee, I am
personally committed to diversity and multiculturalism across the curriculum.
The purpose of this course is to acquaint the student with the discipline of
Sociology and to help the student develop an appreciation for its usefulness
in understanding their culture. Upon completion of this course, students
should be able to apply the Sociological Perspective in the analysis of
everyday life and problems which confront them.

_Special Assignments and Activities:_

Four exams and a Course Diary. The composition of the exams will be matching,
completions, true or false, multiple choice, multiple choice essay questions
and short answer essays (short answer essays test the diversity component:
discussion and notes on viewing of Videos "Sociology Live". We will view video
tapes on the diverse groups of focus; the European Americans, the Native
Americans, the African Americans, the Asian Americans and the Hispanic
Americans (primarily the Mexican Americans). Students will be expected to take
notes and will be asked to answer questions as part of the class discussions.
Also students will be asked to answer short answer essay questions as part of
each unit exam. The videos will be viewed and discussed on Feb. 4, Mar. 4,
April 8, and April 22. Course Dairy: in this assignment, students must keep a
diary noting their understandings of the relationships between the lectures,
assigned readings, and newspaper articles (Entries 1 through 4). Students are
also expected to demonstrate their understandings of the relationships between
the lecture, assigned readings and their personal experiences. (Entries 5 and
6). Two of the entries concerning the lecture (1 - 4) must address the
diversity focus groups. Extra Credit Points: Things that make you go
hmmmn........During class, newspaper articles will be discussed that relate to
the content of the lecture. (the articles will refer to the diversity focus
groups). Students will be allowed to write a reaction paper to newspaper
articles. The reaction paper will be awarded points based on the length of the
paper. A page with less than one half of a page will be awarded .5 a page,
with one half of a page will be awarded 1 point, a page with more than half of
a page - but not a complete page will be awarded 1.5 points, and a full page
will be awarded 2 points per page. At the end of Unit 3, the points will be
totaled and the students will decide how to add the points to grades earned on
exams. These papers cannot be turned in late, they are due by the end of the
class period on the due date. Extra Credit Activities: Students will be
allowed to earn extra points by attending programs and events at GCC and
sometimes at other places away from GCC. (The events will center on the
diversity focus groups. During the Spring semester students had an opportunity
to participate in the "Rainbow Connection Experience at GCC and attend the
Wade Smith Memorial Lecture at ASU.

_Difficulties and Successes I've Had:_

The difficulties I had on the diary was getting the students to consistently
write the entries on the diversity focus groups. Also, I had some difficulty
in determining how long to show the video. In my first diversity focused class
I showed the video 15 minutes and discussed the video fifteen minutes. In the
second diversity focused class I showed the video 30 minutes and discussed it
30 minutes, I think the 30 minute segments were more effective. The successes
I've had dealt with the things that make you go hmnnnn discussions, the
students participated very well in the discussions. Also, the students eagerly
participated in the video discussions. I was impressed also, with the quality
of the essay writing the recall was magnificant. In the spring semester I
showed a video on European Americans (Jewish), Native Americans (The Navaho
Tribe), Hispanic Americans (Mexican Americans) and African Americans. Students
who attended the events and participated in the activities also gave favorable
comments about those experiences.

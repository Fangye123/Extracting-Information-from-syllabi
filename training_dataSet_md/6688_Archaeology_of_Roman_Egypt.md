NOTE: This syllabus is for a course that met for its last class session on 23
April 1996. Students in the course are currently completing their final, on-
line projects, links to which will be added to this syllabus as they become
available. In the outline below, individual class topics are linked to
documents containing lecture outlines and/or notes; be aware that these were
intended for in-class use and many are incomplete. This syllabus was recently
moved in a reorganization of my web-space and some of the links may not have
gotten adjusted yet. There will be periodic updates. -TGW, 25 April 1996

#### General Course Description  

### The Archaeology of Roman Egypt:  
Multimedia Investigations of a Multicultural Society  

  
The society of Egypt under Roman rule as interpreted through archaeological
evidence made available to students on-line will be the focus of this course.
Students will explore the cultural, political and ethnic influences that
combined to form the society of Roman Egypt. After an introduction to the
archaeology and history of Roman Egypt and a grounding in relevant computer
techniques, students will investigate problems posed by Roman Egyptian sites
excavated by the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology through on-line resources
designed especially for this course. These resources will include databases of
artifacts, plans and images from sections of two Egyptian sites (Karanis and
Dime), information from excavation reports, historical outlines, translations
of relevant ancient texts--all accessible via the World Wide Web. Using these
materials, students will design and construct interactive on-line
presentations of the results of their research. All student work in the class
will be on-line (including hypertextual critiques/responses to other on-line
sources) and the final class project will be for the students to develop, in
small groups, interactive WWW documents using the data put on-line to examine
problems in the Archaeology of Roman Egypt.

#### Course Prerequisites and Requirements

There are no prerequisites for this course. Although experience with computers
and/or archaeology will be helpful, no prior knowledge is assumed. Computer
skills will be taught in-class, and topics in archaeology and the history of
Roman Egypt will be thoroughly covered in lectures, readings and in-class
discussion.  
Students in the course will be required to do the readings, attend the
lectures, participate in class discussion and do the assignments. As outlined

  * Mid-term exam (30% of grade) 
  * Final project (relevant on-line interactive presentation) (40% of grade)

**Course Objectives**

This graduate readings course will focus on major topics in United States
history in the 1980s related to the presidency of Ronald Reagan. The course
will emphasize reading and discussion of the available memoir literature,
secondary interpretations and historiography. The course will make use of the
exhibits, resources and conferences held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library in Simi Valley. The Reagan Center for Public Affairs will hold two
conferences during the semester, the first in September on "Debating the
Debates: Defining Moments in Presidential Campaigns" before the first 1996
presidential debates, and the second in November on "High Noon at Reykjavik",
the 1986 summit conference between President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev at
Reykjavik, Iceland. This course will be followed in the Spring semester by
History 674 Seminar in Recent United States history which will involve the
preparation of a research paper based in part on the use of the records of the
Reagan presidential library. In 696BC students who wish to take the Spring
seminar will devote some attention to the selection of a research topic while
preparing the secondary reading for the course.

Discussion: Since this is a graduate-level class, discussion will form the
primary focus of our meetings. All students are expected to prepare the weekly
readings before each class, so that you are able to participate actively in
class discussions. Please note that discussion will count for 25% of your
final grade.

Precis and Oral Reports: All students will write two precis on books selected
in areas of interest and possibly related to the topic for the bibliographical
essay. Each precis should be a three page review of which 50% should be a
summary presentation of the focus and major interpretations of the book and
50% should represent a brief critique on the pros and cons of the book, the
perspective and possible bias of the author, the relationship of the book to
other interpretations and topics discussed in the class. Each student will
present an oral report on each precis that summarizes the nature of the book
and attempts to stimulate and lead discussion related to the book. The precis
and oral reports will count for 25% of the final grade.

Bibliographical Essay: All students will prepare a bibliographical essay of
fifteen to twenty pages in length with appropriate endnotes and bibliography.
This essay will count for 50% of the final grade. The essay should focus on a
selected topic and review the pertinent memoirs and secondary sources. The
essay should identify the main issues on the topic and evaluate the different
interpretations. Students who wish to take History 674 in the Spring should
focus their essay on the general area in which they would like to do primary
research. During the semester the class will discuss topic selection and the
nature of a bibliographical essay and all students are required to submit a
preliminary bibliography and outline of the paper before the final draft.

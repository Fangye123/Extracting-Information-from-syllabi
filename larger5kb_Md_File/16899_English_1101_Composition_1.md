  ** _SYLLABUS_** _While this syllabus is carefully planned, it may be
modified at any time in response to the needs and interests of the class, and
it is quite likely to be augmented with additional links of interest and
further details of daily class activities.   Such details as the grading
criteria, absence policy, etc., are _guaranteed not to change_.   You should
have all readings prepared exactly as described (i.e., completed before the
class is scheduled to discuss them), but you should also be ready to make
careful note of any schedule changes made in response to the needs and
progress of the group.  It is your responsibility to be prepared by checking
the online syllabus regularly and, should you have to miss a class, by calling
one of your colleagues to catch up on the discussion and to ascertain that no
schedule changes have been made in your absence._

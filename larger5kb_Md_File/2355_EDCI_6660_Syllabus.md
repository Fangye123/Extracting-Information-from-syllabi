In order to achieve the expectations and objectives listed for this course, it
seems to me that we are obliged to share a number of responsibilities. I am
responsible in large measure for making the course a viable, interesting and
worthwhile experience. You in turn are responsible for helping to achieve
these goals. You must not only feel free to discuss issues and ideas dealt
with in class-- you must do so if our dialogue is to have the desired payoff.
I am assuming that class sessions will be worthwhile and that you will attend.
I am also assuming that you will complete the assigned readings and that it
makes sense to do so. I hope that you will extend beyond the recommended
readings in search of answers to questions you have about using technology in
education. In the final analysis, your responsibilities, as I view them, are
not to me, but to yourselves, to your classmates, and to your students.

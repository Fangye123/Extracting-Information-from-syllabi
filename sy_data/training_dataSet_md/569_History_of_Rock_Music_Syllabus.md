Audio examples will be listed on our web site; URLs to our reading examples are listed below (and on the web site). You will need to go through UT's PH Alias/PH Password verification process.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

  * Two Mid-Term Exams (25% each) 50%

  * Journal Writing Projects (This is a writing-emphasis course.) 25%

    * Fourteen (14) in-class entries. Approximately once a week there will be an unannounced journal entry written in class on an assigned topic. You will have five minutes to write. You may drop one in-class entry this semester.

    * Fourteen (14) out-of-class entries. By each Monday's class, you must have completed a one-page contribution to the History of Rock web site on the topic of the week.

**MAKE-UP POLICY FOR ALL EXAMS AND WRITTEN PROJECTS:** With the exception
below, there are no make-ups for midterm exams, final exams, in-class or out-
of-class journal-writing entries. If you miss an in-class entry or a mid-term
exam because of an UTK official event or a verified hospital stay you may make
it up only with an official note on letterhead from your department or doctor.
A missed midterm exam, because of a UTK official event or a verified hospital
stay, will be made-up by counting the more difficult final exam twice. Missed
finals due to a verified hospital stay with a note on letterhead from your
doctor will result in an incomplete in the course that will be removed through
an additional written assignment or another exam.

#### Prerequisites

CSC 310 or CSC 336 or equivalent programming experience.

#### Overview

This course teaches how to program in Java and focuses on concepts and
applications that the language best addresses. Concepts include those
associated with object-oriented programming, event-driven programming and
distributed computing. Applications include JDBC (database access), graphical
user interfaces, applets and servlets.

#### Goals

  * Understand the strengths and weakness of Java 
  * Master object-oriented concepts and apply them to real-world problems. 
  * Learn how to read Java documentation and use the classes described by it. 

#### Projects

  1. Six assignments (best 5 will be scored) 
  2. One group project 

#### Grade Determination

25% (50 points)  | Assignments (10 points each)  
---|---  
10% (20 points)  | Group Project  
20% (40 points)  | Quizzes (20 points each)  
20 % (40 points) | Midterm  
25 % (50 points) | Final  
  
Students receiving more than 90% of possible points are guaranteed at least an
A-, more than 80% at least a B-, more than 70% at least a C-, and more than
60% at least a D.

#### Policies

While attendance does not comprise a formal part of the grade, students are
expected to attend all classes and participate in in-class exercises. Class
will start promptly at 6:15. Students are individually responsible for
material they may have missed due to absence or tardiness.

The group project will be completed in groups of three or four. While students
will have some control on group selection, the instructor reserves the right
to modify groups in order to meet course objectives. While the group may
assign a primary role to each group member, all group members are jointly
responsible for the entire assignment. Generally, each group member will
receive the same grade. However, in some cases, additional credit may go to
those who make an exceptional contribution to a project and reduced credit to
those who contribute little to a project.

Quizzes and tests can only be made up with a serious documented excuse (e.g.
illness, death in the family). A make-up quiz or test must be arranged as soon
as possible and always before the student attends the next class meeting.
Arrangements involving other excuses require prior permission from the
instructor.

Assignments will be submitted [online through the
Web](http://cmiller.cs.depaul.edu:8080/upload/servlet/FileSubmission). While
students should plan to complete their assignments by classtime on Thursday,
assignments will be accepted until 11:30pm the following day (Friday) without
any penalty. Assignments submitted after Friday will generally not be
accepted.

Assignments submitted by email are generally not accepted.

#### University Policies

**Plagiarism:** The university and school policy on plagiarism can be
summarized as follows: Students in this course, as well as all other courses
in which independent research or writing play a vital part in the course
requirements, should be aware of the strong sanctions that can be imposed
against someone guilty of plagiarism. If proven, a charge of plagiarism could
result in an automatic F in the course and possible expulsion. The strongest
of sanctions will be imposed on anyone who submits as his/her own work a
report, examination paper, computer file, lab report, or other assignment
which has been prepared by someone else. If you have any questions or doubts
about what plagiarism entails or how to properly acknowledge source materials
be sure to consult the instructor.

**Incomplete:** An incomplete grade is given only for an exceptional reason
such as a death in the family, a serious illness, etc. Any such reason must be
documented. Any incomplete request must be made at least two weeks before the
final, and approved by the Dean of the School of Computer Science,
Telecommunications and Information Systems. Any consequences resulting from a
poor grade for the course will not be considered as valid reasons for such a
request.

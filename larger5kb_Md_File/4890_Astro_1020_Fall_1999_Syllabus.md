**Office Hours:** Tues. 11-noon  & Wed.: 10-11, & by appointment.

_Required Text_ :   Chaisson and McMillan, **Astronomy Today** , 3rd Edition,
Prentice Hall

**GENERAL INFORMATION:** Chaisson and McMillan is an excellent text, but will
not include all the material in my lectures (and of course, I will not cover
everything in the text). Many of you might benefit from looking at texts with
different viewpoints; other excellent books are: _Astronomy Today_ , W.J.
Kaufmann, _Universe_ and T.P. Snow, _The Dynamic Universe_.

**All students are expected to be familiar with the Policy on Academic Honesty
(p. 56 ff. of the 1998-1999 General Catalog, and to abide by it. Cheating will
certainly earn you a zero on that quiz or exam, and the penalties can be
substantially more severe.**

You are expected to be considerate and respectful of other students; talking
(other than to ask questions of me) or eating in class are forms of
discourtesy. Cell phones and pagers are to be turned off (or at most set to
give tactile, rather than audible, signals) while in class.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:** You are responsible for all the material in the
assigned readings and in the lectures unless you are specifically told
otherwise. While attendance at every lecture is not required, it is expected,
and it will be extremely difficult for any student to get a grade of C or
better if (s)he does not attend nearly every class. If you must miss a
lecture, you should be certain to hand copy the notes of another student as
soon as possible.

You are **strongly encouraged to ask questions before, during or after class**
if something is not clear. If my office hours are not convenient for you, just
make an appointment to meet with me; I am generally available every day. I
_strongly urge_ you to read the assigned sections _before_ the corresponding
lecture. As you do so, note the points with which you have difficulty, so that
if they are not clarified during the class you can immediately raise
questions. Soon after the lecture, carefully (re-)read the corresponding text
sections to reinforce the material.

There will be three one-hour exams, and a cumulative final, which will,
however, emphasize the last portion of the course. All of the questions will
be of a short answer (true/false, multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-
blank, etc.) variety. No more than 25% of any exam will comprise questions
involving simple mathematics. The examination questions will stress the
material covered in class, so punctual attendance and careful notetaking will
be keys to doing well; however, there may well be a few questions asked that
are covered in the text but not the lectures.

The average student will do well in this course if (s)he devotes six to eight
hours a week (outside of lecture and lab) to reading the textbook and
reviewing her or his notes. Answer the questions at the end of each chapter to
test your knowledge of the material.

![tex2html_wrap_inline38](img2.gif) Oct. 24th is the last day to withdraw with
a grade of W possible.

Of course, **modifications to the above schedule may be necessary.**

**GRADING:** Each of the three hour exams will count as 15% of your grade, and
the final as 20%. Two or three pop quizzes and a few assignments will comprise
a total of 10%, and your lab work will count for the remaining 25%.

There will be no make-up exams; if you miss one of the hour tests the final
will substitute for that test and will thus amount to 35% of your grade. If
you miss two of them, you'll receive a zero for one, and the final will still
contribute a maximum of 35 out of 100 points. _Therefore, don't get sick on
more than one exam date._ If the final exam grade is better than any (or all)
of your hour exam grades it will substitute for it (or for the lowest of the
three). There can be no make-up for an unannounced quiz, so missing one yields
a zero.

An average grade of 90% or better guarantees an A for the course, while an
average grade of 80% or better implies a B, an average grade of 70% or better
gets you a C, and an average grade of 60% or better is good enough for a D. If
the mean class grade on an exam falls much below 70% I will usually `curve'
the scores so as to bring the mean up to between 70% and 75%.

If you miss the final, you must contact me within 24 hours of the exam date
[my home number is (770)578-9528], explaining why you missed the exam, and
providing a doctor's note and a phone number where you may be reached. If your
excuse is satisfactory, you will be given a grade of I (incomplete), and the
make-up final exam will be scheduled during the first week of the fall
quarter. It will be of an essay (not short-answer) type.

**THE LABORATORY COMPONENT OF THIS COURSE:** When you registered for this
course you automatically signed up for one of the associated lab sections, to
be held in Room 516-Kell. Before attending the first lab you must have
purchased the lab manual. If you have taken Astr 101 recently, you do not need
to purchase a manual as the one you have contains both sets of labs. Mr. John
Wilson (Rm. 1032-G, Ph: 404-651-1271), is in overall-charge of the labs.
Either Mr. Wilson or one of the Graduate Teaching Assistants will be your lab
instructor. If you have any questions about the labs, be sure to ask your
instructor first, then Mr. Wilson (if he isn't your instructor), not me.
Computer number 1031 corresponds to a lab on Mondays from 9:00 AM--10:50 AM;
1033 to a lab on Tuesdays from 11:00 AM--12:50 PM; 1035 to Fridays from 9:00
AM--10:50 AM.

Your lowest lab score is dropped in computing your lab average, so you can
miss one lab without a major penalty; any subsequent missed lab counts as a
zero, and will have a substantial impact on your lab grade. You are also
required to attend an observing session, the schedule of which will be
announced in the labs. The smart student does this early in the quarter.
Finally, note that you must attend at least 7 labs and an observing session in
order to get credit for this _laboratory science_ course (i.e., if you miss
more than half of the labs, you can't pass the course, even if you have a 100%
average on the exams).

I hope you enjoyed Astr 1010 and that you will find Astr 1020 even more
interesting. Feel free to give me suggestions at any time (in person after
class, or via phone or e-mail) on how we might work together to make this
class better.

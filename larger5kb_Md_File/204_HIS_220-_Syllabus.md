**Course Description:  
** The course studies the development of urban centers in the United States
with special attention to their colonial and frontier roots, their growth
during the age of industrialization and immigration, and their adjustment to
the post-industrial order of the late 20th Century. Topics include the
dynamics of urban growth, politics and reform, urban planning, the
relationship between ethnicity and class, the rise of mass consumption,
changing patterns of family life and gender relations, and shifting
definitions of community.  
  
**Course Objectives:  
** This course has several objectives appropriate to an upper-division course
in American urban history which meets the City perspective:  

  1. At the most basic level, of course, to acquire factual knowledge. This does not imply the memorization of facts but rather an introduction to what historians call "historical evidence"--people ( _who_ ), places ( _where_ ), events, ideas, trends ( _what_ ). This material is the basis for understanding the evolution of American cities.  

  2. To learn basic concepts (theories, if you prefer) useful in understanding _how_ American cities evolved and _why_ they did so in certain ways.  

  3. To apply these concepts to American urban history in order to make sense of the massive amount of evidence. That is, the course should provide the opportunity for interpreting _what_ happened, _why_ it happened (and _why then_ , as opposed to some other era). Finally, we will attempt to assess the significance of this material (the _so what_ question) by asking why something is worth knowing. This process of explanation and interpretation is central to the historian's craft. As we practice understanding people, places, and processes, we will gain a sense of how historians go about their work.  

  4. To develop oral and written expression. Through oral and written assignments, we will gain experience in those forms of scholarly communication.  

  5. To meet the City Perspective of General Education by gaining an understanding of and critically reflect on the historical dimension of urban communities and institutions; the metropolitan areas; and the nature and consequences of metropolitan diversity.  
  

**Course Requirements:  
** Regular class attendance, required readings listed below, two midterm
tests, a research paper/oral presentation, and a comprehensive final. The
research project will address a particular neighborhood in Minneapolis or St.
Paul. The paper should offer an interpretive history of that particular place
in light of the analytical frameworks presented in the course. Each student
will present their findings to the class in an oral presentation.  
Regular class attendance is  required since everyone is expected to take an
active and positive role in the class. The grade for class engagement and
participation will be determined by a mixture of instructor-, peer-, and self-
assessment. Thus, unexcused absences are grounds for a reduction in grade. We
also should make an effort to get to know one another. Accordingly, every
member of the class is required to meet individually with the instructor
during the first three weeks of the semester.  
Exams will be based on the material presented in class as well as the
readings. Except in cases of medical or other emergency, no student will be
allowed to take a make-up exam. In all cases, no make-up will be granted
without permission from me prior to the original test. Students working with
the CLASS Office should contact me about any necessary accommodations.  
Augsburg College has an Academic Honesty Policy which can be found in the
Augsburg Student Guide. It is your responsibility to read and understand that
policy. All students will be asked to sign the following honesty policy
statement:  
I have read and understand the policies of Augsburg College regarding academic
honesty. I understand how they apply to this course, and I pledge myself to
abide by the policies and work to create an atmosphere of academic integrity
on the campus.  
You are encouraged to ask questions about the application of the policy in
this course.  
Grading will follow College policy. Grades will be assigned according to the
following point scale:  
First Test - 50 points  
Second Test - 100 points  
Participation/Engagement - 100 points  
Research Paper - 100 points  
Tour Presentation - 50 points  
Final - 100 points  
  
500 total possible points  
450 = 4.0  
425 = 3.5  
400 = 3.0  
375 = 2.5  
350 = 2.0  
325 = 1.5  
300 = 1.0  
275 = 0.5  
**  
** According to Augsburg College policy, number grades have the following
definitions:  
  
  
4.0 Achieves highest standards of excellence  
3.0 Achieves above basic course standards  
2.0 Meets basic standards for the course

_ __ **Tentative Class Schedule and Reading Assignments:  
** (The schedule will be finalized once arrangements are made for field trips)  
  
Reading assignments are to be completed before the meeting for which they are
assigned. Many class sessions will include large- and small-group discussions
of that day's reading assignment. One should expect the college standard of 2
hours homework per 1 hour of class to apply to this class. That is, you should
put in an average of 6 hours of homework per week.  
The Chudacoff and Smith volume will serve as the course textbook. The other
readings are a mixture of primary and secondary sources on American urban
history. Regarded as some of the most influential books in the field, they
will provide insight into issues of race, class, and gender.

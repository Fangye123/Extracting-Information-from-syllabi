    Religious Responses to the Holocaust     Religious Responses to the Holocaust (Religious Studies 242)  Spring, 1998      Instructor Gary G. Porton			3004 Foreign Languages Building			333-0473			Office Hours Tues & Thur 9:30-10:30 or by appointment     Description The course has two main goals:   To examine the events which resulted in the destruction of European				Jewry during the Holocaust, and 				to investigate some modern Jewish and Christian interpretations				of this destruction. 			 The course is divided into two main sections.   In the first section, we shall study the Nazi rule in Germany				and Europe, its destruction of European Judaism, and the actions				of those nations who participated in WWII. This section focuses				on the events of the Holocaust. 				The second section of the course studies some Jewish and Christian				responses to the destruction of 6,000,000 Jews during WWII. Because				the Jews play a crucial role in Christian, as well as Jewish,				theological systems and because those who destroyed the Jews were				Christians, both Jewish and Christian thinkers have undertaken				a good deal of self-examination in light of the Holocaust. For				this reason, studying their interpretations of the Holocaust will				provide us with a good entry into some of the major issues facing				the two major religious groups of the West. This section focuses				on theological interpretations of the events of the Holocaust.							     II. Requirements  Each student is expected to complete the reading assignments for				each topic before class. In addition, each student is expected				to attend each class session and to participate actively in the				discussions. 				On March 19 each student will hand in a 7-10 page paper discussing				Different Voices. The paper should address the topics of whether				or not the female perspective on the Holocaust offers us unique				information and whether or not women experienced the Holocaust				differently from men. The paper should respond to specific writers				and essays in the book. 				There will be other shorter writing assignments during the semester.								There will not be a midterm or a final for the course. 			     III.

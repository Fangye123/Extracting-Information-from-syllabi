Course Objectives and Methods

The overall objective for this one-credit course is to give students the tools
to help their organizations--schools, non-profit agencies, community service
groups, and businesses--the tools to successfully compete for grant funds.
Individuals working on professional development proposals will also gain the
skills and knowledge to successfully propose research and study plans.
Specific objectives involve

  * assessing organizational needs
  * researching government agencies and private foundations for good fits between grantor goals and organizational needs
  * gaining organizational and community support
  * scrutinizing Requests for Proposals (RFPs), Grant Application Packets, instructions
  * writing effective proposal letters
  * outlining effective proposals
  * outlining management plans
  * outlining evaluation plans
  * developing budgets
  * revising proposals and grant applications in workshops

Methods for accomplishing these goals will primarily involve problem-
based/project-based learning.  Students will identify real organizations with
real needs, and research and write in order to bring about a project through
grant funding that solves a problem or fills a community need.  Students are
encouraged to work in teams.

Assignments & Grading

It would be my preference to grade this course S/U:
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory.  If there are reasons that I can't, then the
following assignments and point values will be used to figure grades.  
  **Assignments & Activities** | **Points**  
---|---  
1 page report assessing the organizational vision, mission, values, and
essential needs | 10  
1-2 page research report on likely funding agencies | 10  
2 page proposal letter | 20  
 2 page outline for complete proposal, following specifications in RFP or
Grant Application Package | 20  
2 page outline for management and evaluation plans, with graphic | 20  
1 page budget | 20  
|  
Optional:  Complete, workshopped grant proposal, fulfilling RFP or Grant
Application Package, ready to mail | 100 points  
  
**Semester Grade Scheme: 100-90 points = A; 89-80 points = B; 79-70 points =
C; 69-60 points = D;**  
**                                             below 60 points = F**

**Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grade Scheme: 70 points or higher =
Satisfactory; below 70 points = Unsatisfactory**

**Attendance**

Attendance is reported so that NMSU-Alamogordo may recapture federal funds
allocated as financial aid to students who fail because they don't come to
class.

For every session you attend, you will get 1 point, up to 15 points.  For
every session you miss, you will lose 10 points.  You may regain 5 points of
the absence penalty 10 points by either (a) writing a half-page chapter
summary for the day you missed, or (b) identifying a new, good granting source
for a fellow student's project.  These "make-up" assignments should be sent
electronically to all class members.

Course Description_**  
        This course uses an anthropological perspective to survey the Native American peoples north of Mexico, ranging from prehistory to the present.    
The first part of the course will cover the prehistoric and historic context
of Native North American peoples, with a particular emphasis on historic
Native  
American and Euro-American contact and interaction.  Then, following the
structure of the textbook, we will examine the culture and history of 11
tribes  
that are generally representative of their region of North America.
Throughout the course I will be stressing three major themes: 1) history and
culture  
contact, 2) politics and economy, and 3) religion and art.  These themes will
be explored in seminars that will allow the opportunity for in-depth  
discussions and debate.  There will also be occasional guest lectures and
films.

**_Goals_**  
        The principal goal of the course is to provide you with a general overview of the rich and varied cultures of the Indian people of North America and   
along the way to dispel many of the stereotypes and unfounded myths about
Indians, which are common in the media and popular culture.  I hope that you  
will also be encouraged to learn more about Indians through study in other
courses (e.g., in history or literature) and to perhaps even consider a Indian  
Studies Program major.  Finally, I hope that you will also be encouraged to
meet and visit with Native Americans.  I will provide information on Native  
American seasonal events, particularly Pow-Wows, which occur relatively
frequently through out Wisconsin.

**_Requirements_**  
        You will be expected to attend all classes and to participate actively in the seminar discussions (this is 10% of your grade).  You can expect a total   
(the combination of the two textbooks and reserve readings) average of
**about** 60-70 pages of reading per week.

        There will be two non-cumulative tests and a final exam for this course.  Tests and the exam will consist of short answer and essay questions.    
Students will be responsible for material in the readings and for material
covered in class, most of which will not be found in the readings.

        There will also be an 8-10 page research paper due at the end of the semester.  The topics can be selected from a list to be distributed later or you   
can choose your own topic, provided it has the instructor's approval.  Feel
free to ask for help during the process of researching, outlining & writing
your  
term paper.  You must have an approved topic for your term paper by Oct 5.  
An outline is due October 24.  The completed paper is due Dec 7.  Together,
the paper and outline are worth 20% of your grade.

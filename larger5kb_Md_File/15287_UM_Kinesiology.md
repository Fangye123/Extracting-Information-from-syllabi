**Short Description: Consumer behavior; marketing sports participation and
healthy lifestyles** ****  
---  
  
Dr. Moore's research focuses on the emotions and attitudes of consumers in the
sport and fitness industry.  
  
Building upon society's interest in physical fitness and healthy lifestyles,
he has been investigating consumer attitudes and emotional response to
dieting, an example of goal-directed behavior. Within this theoretical
framework, his recent research has also focused on the impact of individual
differences in the consumer's ability to resist unhealthy food temptations.  
  
Moore has also done extensive research on the role of visual stimuli on the
consumer's emotional response to advertising appeals. He is currently
investigating the impact of corporate sponsorship brand name exposure during
the broadcast of televised sports.

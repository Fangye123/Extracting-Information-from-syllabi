You will learn more and do better on the examsif you do the readings prior to lectures. Attendance and participation in Discussion Sections are crucialmeans of learning the material and are therefore mandatory (about 20%of the grade or narrative evaluation). There will be two, short, multiple-choice mid-term exams (20%total) and a comprehensive final exam (40%), all covering lectures aswell as readings. Beyond section participation and the 3 exams, each student willwrite a five-page essay (20%), double-spaced, which uses thesociological concepts and theories from readings and lectures toanalyze the cases examined in Barry Glassner's provocative new book,The Culture of Fear. You should begin reading this book right awayand plan to finish it before the middle of the quarter. A guide tothe core questions you will be expected to address in this essay willbe handed out in discussion sections later. Students are stronglyencouraged to exchange drafts of their essays with a "study buddy" oftheir choosing for comments and editing before turning them in. Theseessays are due no later than Wednesday, November 24th, in classbefore lecture.

We will establish the peculiarity of "the modernWestern family" system by placing it in historical and cross-culturalperspective. We will focus on p ower relationships both within andbeyond "the family," with attention to the impact of social processessuch as deindustrialization, immigration, colonialism, and systems ofinstitutionalized inequality along multiple axes. We will analyze thecultural politics of "family values" concluding with a focus on the"postmodern family condition" which is the condition of politicizedcontest over the legitimacy of contemporary family diversity in theUnited States.

College 8, Room 320Phone: 459 5503 (office); 650 367 8272 (home); 650 245 6769(mobile)e-mail: bencrow@cats.ucsc.edu Course Description WINTER 1999 SYLLABUS. SOME READINGS WILL CHANGE FOR FALL 2000. This course will examine some of the pressing issues relating toglobal inequality and international development, including: hungerand vulnerability; East Asian development and financial crisis;environment and industrial development; colonial and postcolonialideas of progress. It will use these issues as a starting point forthe discussion of the history of development and underdevelopment,the rise of agriculture and industry, and for theories which attemptto explain that history. These theories help to provide a grasp of astrange world in which the world's 3 richest individuals have moreassets than the gross domestic product of the world's 48 poorestcountries. Three groups of ideas on development and underdevelopment will bethe primary focus of the course: i) the 'Washington Consensus', ii)dependency ideas, iii) Marxian ideas. The Washington Consensus, alsoknown as Market Friendly and Structural Adjustment ideas, is theruling global consensus on development. It describes the theoreticalfoundations of the policies propagated by the International MonetaryFund and the World Bank. Dependency ideas grew out of Latin Americanexperiences, they explore the consequences of colonialism and themakings of the global system, and provide one alternative to theWashington Consensus. A second alternative school of developmentideas derives from the tradition of Karl Marx, and applies theanalysis of social class dynamics to the understanding of developmentand underdevelopment. One book we will be reading (Kiely 1995) argues that developmenttheories have reached an impasse, that is, they suffer debilitatingtheoretical weaknesses and fail to explain the contemporary world. Welive, nevertheless, in a time when thinking about these issues hasnever been more exciting. We will also be looking at some ideas fromfeminism and post-structural analysis, and will be able to assess theextent to which the impasse in development theory can beovercome.

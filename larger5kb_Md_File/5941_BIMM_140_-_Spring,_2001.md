### BIMM 140 Course Objectives

In this course, you will learn about publicly available data resources and a
variety of approaches to the analysis of nucleic acid and protein sequences.
These approaches comprise the core bioinformatics techniques used in genomic
and post-genomic projects.

In the lectures we will present the concepts and algorithms behind the
methods. The Midterm and Final exams will cover these lectures and the
assigned readings; it will not cover the details of how to run specific
software.

BIMM 140 will examine a broad range of topics in a short period. Our attention
will focus on the available public data resources and how to find relevant
information, the detection of homologous sequences and how they are used to
create an "information map" allowing us to make inferences about the structure
and function of novel molecules based on previously known molecules, nucleic
acid and protein structure prediction methods, phylogenetic relationships, and
a brief look at homology based structural modeling.



### Grading:

**BIMM 140 Grading**  
---  
  
**Course Requirements** |

**Content** |

**% of  
Grade**  
Midterm: Wednesday 1 May; in class | First half of class | 40%  
Final Exam: **TBA** |  Entire class | 60%  
  


### Textbooks and Readings:



  1. Required Textbook: "Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis. " David W. Mount. 

This new book covers almost all of the material covered in this course in
sufficient detail that, although expensive, it should be worth keeping as a
reference. Two copies of the text are on reserve in the Biomed library.
Chapter readings are associated with given lectures as shown in the
[Syllabus](bimm140_syllabus.html).  
**

Questions on the Midterm and Final exams will, in part, be based on material
in the required text.

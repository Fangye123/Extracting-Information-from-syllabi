This course will examine some fundamental questions for public administration
in the United States as we approach the millennium: _What_ does (should)
government do, and _how_? _Where_ , and _by whom_ (national, state, or local
government, public or private agencies) should these goods and services be
provided? _Why_ do public officials and agencies do what they do? _How_ can
they be changed to better serve the public?

These questions are not new, and they have no simple answers. Reading a
textbook is only the first step in searching for answers. In this class,
textbook reading will be supplemented by analyzing "cases" - problems faced by
public administrators as they do their jobs - drawn from current issues and
recent history. The cases are intended to enhance your understanding of what
it is like to be a public official, to apply general ideas to specific
situations and gain a sense of how "solutions" must be adapted to a particular
context. Through reading, thinking about and discussing the cases, you will
also develop skills in critical thinking and interpersonal relations which can
be applied in many settings outside the classroom. What you learn from the
cases will depend to a large extent on what you put into them - preparation
before class discussions, attentiveness during discussions, and thoughtful
reflection afterwards will greatly enhance your learning experience.

Course Requirements and Grading

Your grade for this class will be based on your performance on tests and
written assignments, and on participation in class discussions. Grading will
be based on a point system, with a total possible 1000 points. Letter grades
will be assigned based on percentage of possible points, as follows: 92 % and
above - A, 88 % - A-, 84 % - B+, 80 % - B, 76 %, B-, 72 % - C+, 68 % - C, 64 %
- C-, 60 % - D+, 56 % - D, 52 % - D-, below 52 % , F.

1\. What you learn from case studies is as important as what you learn from
the textbook. Attendance, participation, and preparation are essential. You
are expected to attend class, read the assigned materials (text and cases),
and participate in discussions. Some case materials are available on-line;
internet addresses for these are provided in the syllabus. Those cases that do
not have internet addresses are in a course pack, which is available at the
Student Bookstore on Bancroft Street. The case component of your grade will be
based on written responses to study questions before the case discussion
and/or review questions after the discussion, and on participation in case
discussions. Each case is worth a maximum of 50 points (written assignments
and participation).

2\. To learn first hand about how government operates, you are to attend a
public meeting of a government organization -- city council, school board,
county commissioners, or similar body. Prepare a report on the meeting in
which you describe what happened (what topics were on the agenda, names of
public officials in attendance, number of people present, groups or
organizations represented, any decisions or votes that took place) and what
you learned about public administration from attending the meeting. This
assignment must be completed by April 26, for class presentations. (100
points)  
    
3\. There will be two tests and a final examination. Material from the
textbook and from class lectures and discussions will be covered on each test.
Test 1, on February 22, will cover material on Parts I, II, and III of the
course outline. Test 2, on April 14, will cover material on Parts IV and V.
These exams will have multiple choice and short answer questions. The final
examination will be comprehensive, and will have multiple choice, short
answer, and essay questions. Each test is worth 100 points, and the final
examination is worth 200 points.

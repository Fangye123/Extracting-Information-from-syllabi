HISTORY OF MANHOOD IN AMERICA, 1750-1940 History 52Swarthmore CollegeProf. Bruce DorseySpring1999 This course is designed to allow students to explore the meaningsof manhood and the various constructions of masculine identity inAmerica between the late-18th century and the beginning of the 20thcentury. The negative images (opposites) against which manhood hasbeen constructed, such as womanhood, boyhood, dependency, slavery,and racial and class difference, will be examined. Topics includepolitics, work, family, sexuality, race, war and violence, sports,drinking, and the myth of the self-made man. It is a course on thecultural and social history of gender in America.   REQUIRED READINGS: The following books are required readings and available at theCollege Bookstore:  E. Anthony Rotundo, American Manhood.      Mark C. Carnes and Clyde Griffen, eds., Meanings for   Manhood.      Mark C. Carnes, Secret Ritual and Manhood in Victorian   America.      Bertram Wyatt-Brown, Honor and Violence in the Old   South.      Gail Bederman, Manliness and Civilization.      Ava Baron, Work Engendered: Toward a New History of   American Labor.      George Chauncey, Gay New York.  Elliott Gorn, The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in   America.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: Reading and Class Participation: Students are expected toattend all class meetings, including films and guest lecturesscheduled outside of class. The following is the History Departmentpolicy on attendance: "Students are required to attend all classesfor the successful completion of the course. Unexcused absences willresult in a lower grade." Students are encouraged to complete theassigned readings before every class meeting, and be prepared fordiscussion. Students should have all the reading completed before adiscussion meeting. Short Papers: Two short papers (6-8 pages) will bewritten over the course of the semester. The essays will be basedprimarily on the optional reading list, but should also try tointegrate the class lectures, discussion, and assigned readings. Theshort paper will allow students to do in-depth studies of topics forwhich the course can only provide a rudimentary exposure. Studentscan decide among a choice of topics based on the optional readinglist. The short papers are not designed to be research papers, butrather analytical essays integrating assigned and optional readings.(A handout will be distributed outlining the expectations and topicsfor the short papers.) First Paper Due: February 22. Second Paper Due: April 19.  Document Discovery and Analysis: Each student will write abrief paper (3-4 pages) on an historical document that theydiscovered that was relevant and revealing for the history ofmasculinity in America between 1750 and 1940. A copy, or a briefsynopsis, of the document must be appended to the paper. Studentswill then analyze the gendered meanings inherent within the documentand relate it to the material covered during this course. Studentswill be evaluated based on the originality, creativeness, andingenuity in finding a document, and on their historical analysis ofthat document. Assistance will be given in locating sources ofpossible documents. Examinations: There will be an in-class midterm examinationand a final examination on the date and time scheduled by the CollegeRegistrar. The exams will be based on the assigned readings, classlectures and discussions.

## Course Description

Practitioners in political science, as across the social sciences more
generally, distinguish between quantitative and qualitative methods. They
thereby falsely dichotomize the range of methods applicable to their research
questions. Some statistical methods, for instance the entire range of non-
parametrics, are qualitative. Conversely, some methods considered qualitative,
notably interviewing and content-analytic techniques, often serve in
preliminary, coding steps of studies ordinarily considered quantitative.

Nevertheless, despite the falseness of the dichotomy that distinguishes them
from quantitative methods, we can characterize the scope of qualitative
methods as those that support directly analyses of human talk, text, and
interaction. As these necessarily comprise the primary data of any
conceivable, self-respecting science of politics, the development of methods
for their analysis ought to be the prime task of political methodology, and
the transmittal of the techniques of these methods ought to stand within the
core of the political science graduate curriculum. That ordinarily they do not
stands as a central embarrassment of the discipline.

This course begins a small, local rectification. Students will be introduced
to a family of text-based qualitative techniques that the instructors and
others have found useful in the conduct of empirical political research,
ranging widely in terms of their degree of formality. Students will be
introduced to no canned computer programs or routinized exercises analogous to
those typically provided in courses on quantitative methods. Students can
nevertheless take from this course an array of skills they should find useful,
both for academic and practical purposes.

As indicated in the course schedule below, on several occasions faculty guests
will visit our seminar to discuss applications of qualitative methods in their
research.

## Grading Criteria

Students may select among two options for their grades in this course, on the
basis of either (a) two examinations or (b) one journal-length research essay.
Students who opt for the examinations need not produce an essay and students
who opt for the essay need not take the examinations. Students who take the
examinations can decide in the end to produce a research paper instead. In
that case, the examination grades will not count and the final grade will be
based on the research essay. _Students who opt for the research essay may not
change their minds after the first examination is administered_.

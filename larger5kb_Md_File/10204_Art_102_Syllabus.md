**Attendance**  
It is in your best interest to attend all course lectures. Attendance will be
recorded during each class. Numerous absences are sure to negatively affect
your grade. The instructor reserves the right to drop any student from this
course with four or more absences.

If you wish to drop this course, it is your responsibility to submit a drop
card to the Admissions Office by the appropriate deadline. If you neglect to
officially drop this course, and you have missed 4 or more class lectures, you
may receive a grade of F.

Top

**Grading**  
Students will be graded on three exams, or two exams and a Research Paper, a
cumulative final exam and an optional extra credit museum review. The grading
scale is as follows:  
A 100% - 90%  
B 89% - 80%  
C 79% - 70%  
D 69% - 60%  
F 59% or less  
Exams  
Exams #1, #2, and #3 will be worth 100 points each and will consist of slide
identifications, multiple choice questions, fill-in-the blank questions, and
essay questions. The final exam will be worth 200 points, and will include new
and previously covered material.

Exams may NOT be made up. Instead, you may drop your lowest exam score by
writing a Research Paper. You may elect to drop your lowest test score by
writing a Research Paper even if you have been present for every exam. The
Final Exam is mandatory and may not be made up.

Top

**Research Paper**  
Students may choose to write one 4 to 5 page Research Paper to replace their
lowest test score or to make up for no more than one missed exam. The Research
Paper will be worth a maximum of 100 points. This paper should follow MLA
guidelines, and have a minimum of three sources cited.

Students should choose any work of art, any artist or any artistic movement
covered in the course, which sparks their interest. The artwork should be
analyzed on a formal level and on a personal level. Consideration and research
should be given to the historical and social context the work was made in.

The artwork does not have to be one that you enjoy. Often, examining the
background of a work that you particularly dislike, and discussing exactly why
you dislike it, is just as interesting as examining a work that you enjoy.

**Extra Credit Museum Review**  
Visiting an art gallery or museum and writing a 2 to 3 page review of what you
saw and experienced may earn up to 50 points extra credit. A list of art
viewing places is provided in this syllabus. This extra credit Museum Review
should follow MLA guidelines, and some sort of documentation, or proof of your
visit should accompany the paper (i.e. ticket stub, museum pamphlet,
"visitor" sticker, etc.).

Various other opportunities for extra credit points may be offered throughout
the course.

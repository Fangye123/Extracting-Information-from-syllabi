ON RESERVE: _COURSE PACKET_  
_COURSE DESCRIPTION

_ This course looks at representative works relating to North America and its
peoples, traditions, stories, and histories. While the course is intended to
stop at 1900, you'll note that some texts are authored after that date. These
works have been included because they provide significant and useful
perspectives. We'll cover different regions, different voices, examine ideas
about what makes a work literary, and what (if anything) is  "American" about
these texts or our interpretations.

Throughout the semester, there will be an emphasis on critical reading and
thinking: challenging assumptions, marking similarities or differences across
and against our expectations. In addition, we will pay particular attention to
each text's social, popular, historical and cultural location.

The course places an emphasis on class discussions and responses. You will be
expected to contribute significantly to the class discussions. Most
importantly--you will be responsible for having completed readings on the day
indicated.

_REQUIREMENTS/GRADING_

Attendance/Class Participation/Quizzes   10% of grade  
Discussion Leadership  5% of grade  
worksheets (4)  10% of grade  
Research Paper (1)  25k of grade  
Mid-Term Exam  25% of grade  
Final Exam  25% of grade

_GENERAL POLICIES_

**ATTENDANCE:** The attendance grade is computed with class participation/quiz
grade. The attendance grade formula is as follows:  
A: No more than 2 unexcused absences  
B: No more than 3 unexcused absences  
C: No more than 4 unexcused absences  
D: No more than 5 unexcused absences  
F: 6 or more unexcused absences

The only  "excused" absence is one supported with reasonable documentation:
i.e., doctor's note, for example. A cautionary note of my own: since we will
cover much key material in class discussions and lectures, you skip class at
your own risk.

QUIZZES: Quizzes will pop-up if and when the class discussion seems to be
lagging and or texts are not read as assigned (i.e. on schedule).

LATE-WORK: No Late Work will be accepted for worksheets. As both the mid-term
and final are in-class, late-work in these cases is neither applicable or
acceptable. I will accept the research paper late but there is a penalty. Each
class day that the research paper is late, your grade will be lowered by a
letter grade.

_EXAMS_  
Questions for a take-home mid-term will be handed out on Friday, Feb.  
24\. The mid-term is due in-class (no exceptions!) on Wed. March 1.  
FINAL: The final exam schedule is listed on the syllabus. Finals will be given
in class, in our regularly scheduled classroom.

_GUIDELINES FOR LEADING CLASS DISCUSSIONS_

An attached sign-up sheet is for your reference; another will be passed around
the class for sign-up purposes. Choose an author, interest, text, etc. on
which you want to lead a class discussion. Sign up for that day.

The responsibilities of the daily discussion leader are:

  * \- Provide interesting, discussion-provoking questions, 
  * \- Offer your own textually-supported interpretation and use it to generate discussion,  

  * \- Provide background information if and when applicable or useful,  

  * \- and, most importantly, ask the questions everybody else is afraid to ask!

You will also be expected to turn in a typed list of the questions you plan to
use to lead the class discussion. This list of questions must be handed in on
the day you lead the class discussion (no late work is accepted).

_GUIDELINES FOR WORKSHEETS_

There are a total of 4 worksheets due (for due dates, see syllabus). NO LATE
WORKSHEETS ARE ACCEPTED (unless a reasonable excuse--i.e. doctor's note--is
provided with the late work). The worksheets are graded on a
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.

The worksheets are designed to be thought/response pieces. While you should
always proofread your writing for spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc., I want
you to focus on content. It will not be necessary to document quotes with
citations or to do any research for these worksheets. (In fact, please don't
do either.)

Any additional requirements or parameters will be explained in class and/or
with each worksheet assignment.

_GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH PAPER_

The paper is expected to be a short research paper--i.e. it must indicate some
library research into your chosen topic, and include appropriate citations and
a bibliography. The paper must follow MLA guidelines (see the MLA Handbook for
Writers of Research Papers). It should run between 5-7 double-spaced pages.
PLEASE DO NOT EXCEED THAT LENGTH. Since this is a formal paper, you will be
graded on punctuation, grammar, well-developed ideas, and clearly written
prose.

The paper must develop a thesis--an analytic focus or argument--which focuses
on at least one of the syllabus texts (i.e., the paper must only analyze texts
on the syllabus and may discuss texts appearing after the essay's due date). I
will not assign topics, but will be happy to discuss any of your ideas. In
order to help you get keep on track, you will be expected to hand in a 1-page
short proposal/description of your paper. This paper proposal will be due on
Friday, March 17.

The research paper is due on Monday, April 17.

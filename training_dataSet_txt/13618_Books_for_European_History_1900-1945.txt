Books for European History 1900-1945



Query From Ginger S. Frost  Ginger.S.Frost@samford.edu 04 May 1998


I am now immersed in ordering books for the Fall 1998 semester.
I am teaching, for the first time, a class called "Europe in Two World Wars,
1900-45." I would like to include some works by and about women in the class,
of course, but these must be (1)fairly short (not over 300 pages);
(2) in print in English in paperback.


My preliminary attempts to find such works have been frustrating. Louise Bryant's
account _Six Red Months in Moscow_ is in print only in hardback. Maria Botchkareva's
memoir of her time in the Women's Battalion of Death is not in print.
Vera Brittain's _Testament of Youth_ is available, but is 672 pp. long.
[I do not object to making students read alot of pages, but I would
rather these be a large variety of books than fewer long ones.]


So, here is my request to the list:
(1) What works *by* women (which meet the criteria) do you
use in similar classes? What would you recommend? Are there
women's accounts of the European depression, e.g., that match those of
George Orwell for England or Hans Fallada for Germany? Or of the Spanish
Civil War? Of the Popular Front? Of Italian Facisim? Of World War II/Holocaust?


(2) What historical accounts of women during that time work the best with undergraduates? What works
would list members consider essential in such a class?


Keep in mind this is a junior/senior level class (no grad students)
and is purely European history. Please no U.S. history--there is
a separate class for that. Thanks in advance.

I have a few suggestions for you. I warn you in advance that my
selection is skewed towards my specialty, German history.


The best fit for your criteria that I can think of off the top of my
head is:


Maria Sophia Quine, Population Politics in Twentieth-Century Europe
(London and New York: Routledge, 1996) 152 pp. ISBN: 0-415-08069-X. Call
Number: HB 3599 Q46


Quine's book has the great advantage of being brief enough for an
undergraduate class (it was certainly written for this audience), but
comprehensive enough to provide a good comparative perspective (she
covers France, Germany and Italy in separate chapters). The subject of
population politics is extremely important for women's history in Europe
as it centres on reproductive policies and related ideologies. I believe
that Quine is a specialist in Italian history, but I was impressed with
her balanced presentation of the German case. (My dissertation deals
with population politics in Germany.) The book is certainly in print --
I just ordered it for a course on European Gender History.


There are also many appropriate books by women about women in Germany.
On the Holocaust: I'm sure at least one of Lucy Dawidowicz's books are
in print. I don't believe that she focuses on women (though her memoir
might be worth looking at) but her books meet your other criteria. More
on topic, though a little long, would be


Claudia Koonz, Mothers in the Fatherland: Woman, the Family, and Nazi
Politics (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1981) ISBN: 0-312-02256-5
(00023195) Call number: HQ 1623 K66 1987


This is a very frequently used and useful book about which much could be
said. If it is too long for your purposes, you might consider Koonz's
condensations of her argument in the following (both of which are in
print):


Claudia Koonz, "The Fascist Solution to the Woman Question in Italy and
Germany," in Becoming Visible: Women in European History, eds. Renate
Bridenthal, Claudia Koonz, and Susan Stuard (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
1987), pp. 499-533


Claudia Koonz, "Mothers in the Fatherland," in The Nazi Revolution:
Hitler's Dictatorship and the German Nation, ed. Allan Mitchell
(Lexington, Mass: D.C. Heath, 1990) only a few pages


Finally, if you have some time to spend on Nazism and would like to
include an oral history perspective, you might consider using some or
all of:


Alison Owings, Frauen: German Women Recall the Third Reich. 2nd ed. (New
Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1993) 494 pp. ISBN:
0-14-023733-X  Call Number: D 811.5 O885 1993


Owings is a journalist. The book contains her accounts of interviews
with a range of women who lived through fascism in Germany: from
"normal" women relating their everyday life experiences, to the wife of
a prominent resister and a female concentration camp guard. Each story
is emotionally powerful and provides much fuel for discussion.


I hope this is helpful!

Try Virginia Woolf's Three Guineas for a work by a woman between the
wars.Deals with feminism and fascism, is short, and in paper.

Some suggestions for texts by and about women for Europe in Two World
Wars:

     Irene Rathbone's _We That Were Young_  and Helen Zenna Smith's _Not
So Quiet . . . Stepdaughters of War_ are both novels about British women in
WWI published in the 1930s and relatively recently reissued by Feminist
Press and Virago - the Rathbone is over 300 but much shorter than Vera
Brittain; both are also at least as much texts about the interwar
period, when they were written, as about the war years themselves.

     Rebecca West's novel _The Return of the Soldier_ (1918) deals
gender and class in wartime England.

     if you are interested in poetry, women's poetry of war has been
anthologized (though, unfortunately, usually separately from men's) -
Catherine Reilly has done both _Scars upon my heart: Women's poetry and
verse of the first world war_ and a similar book for WWII, I think
called _Chaos of the Night_.

     Virginia Woolf is of course always a good choice - _Three Guineas_,
_A Room of One's Own_, or _Mrs. Dalloway_, for example.

     Olive Schreiner's _Woman and Labour_ (1911) might be interesting as
well - not about the wars, obviously - but very much about the position
of women in early 20th century society.

     You might also want to take a look at some of Elizabeth Bowen's
novels about Britain in WWII.

     As for secondary literature, I think that is more complicated -
there is quite a bit, but much of it may be too specific for the scope of your
course, and much of it may also be too sophisticated for undergraduates.
You might want to take a look at some of the essays in Higonnet, et al.,
Behind the Lines: Gender and the Two World Wars (Yale, 1987); Cooke and
Woollacott, Gendering War Talk (Princeton, 1993); and the new (1998)
Melman, _Borderlines: Genders and Identities in War and Peace.
This are obviously skewed toward Britain and WWI, as that is what I know
best - hope it helps.

Two paperbacks that you might take a look at are Emilie Carles'
wonderful _A Life of Her Own_ (Penguin), and Bonnie Smith's _Confessions
of a Concierge_ (Yale).  There are also deBeauvoir's memoirs, and many
French women have left memoirs of varying importance.


Your msg suggests you seek only primary sources:  if you are also
looking for secondary sources on how the wars impacted women, gender,
etc, please let me know....


For example, Lou (Mary Louise) Roberts Civilization Without Sexes is a
great read.  Jay Winter, _Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning_.... there
is an awful lot being produced on this period right now....

 There is a terrific WWI reader with home front and women's coverage,
called *World War I and European Society:  A Sourcebook* eds. Coetzee
and Shevin-Coetzee.
   There is a SHORT book I believe still in Penguin paperback called
*Mischling Second Degree* by Ilse Koehn that is a girl's experience in
Nazi Germany.
   A bit longer is Marianne MacKinnon, who grew up under Nazism at
first accepting it, but I don't have the title handy.

Have you looked at the book:  _Wartime women : An Anthology of women's
Wartime Writing for Mass-Observation, 1937-45_?  It was edited by Dorothy
Sheridan and published in 1990 by Heinemann. It is available in paperback. It tells
the story of women in Great Britain during World War II through journals kept by
the women during the period for a government-sponsored project.

I think Kollontai's short story about the worker bee is fantastic, but I
don't think it's in print.  Anna Akhmatova's poetry should be included too --
Requiem.  For WWI, I have taught Helen Zinnia Smith's Not So Quiet
(Feminist Press) which is very powerful; Gerda Klein's memoir All But My Life,
and Mine Okubo's memoir of Japanese American internment Citizen 13660.  Mary
Lee Settle's All the Brave Promises is really powerful, and I think there
are terrific excerpts from Stein, Wars I Have Seen. Martha Gellhorn, any
novel of WWII.


Kay Boyle's short story "Defeat" is fantastic, as if Dorothy Parker's
"Lovely Leave." re Spain: Muriel Rukeyser's poetry including "Mediterranean",
Dorothy Parker's short story "Soldiers of the Republic."
These are some suggestions, and there is Klein's 1977 collection Beyond
the Home Front (NYU) which contains women's autobiographical writing --
don't know if it's in paper.

Some ideas on women in war:


Winter, J.M. "Catastrophe and Culture: Recent Trends in the
Historiography of the First World War." Journal of Modern History 64
(Sept. 1992): 525-32.


A good starting point, perhaps, in that Winter discusses the
incorporation of gender into WWI studies. One often cited book that he
mentions is


Margaret Higgonet, et al. _Behind the Lines: Gender and the Two World
Wars_. New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1987.


I haven't looked at it myself but it may be usable. Another book I am
familiar with and that was not translated when Winter wrote his piece is


Daniel, Ute. _The War From Within: German Working-Class Women in the
First World War_. Translated by Margaret Ries. New York: Berg, 1997.


Daniel's argument is pretty important to work on WWI in Germany in that
she counters the notion that the war experience ultimately improved
working women's roles. I read this in a mixed grad/undergrad class on
Germany. It worked OK, but I found (as a grad student) the translation
difficult to understand.


Another idea about Germany in WWII may be Alison Owings' _Frauen_. (I
don't have the cite on this one.) She interviewed several German women

 Nazi sympathizers, rural laborers, urban workers, mothers, resistors,
etc. -- in the 1980s and documented their experiences on the home front.
It's rather lengthy, but divided up by each woman, so you may be able to
assign portions of the book. Also, it's very readable.

In response to Ginger Frost's question about paperbacks by women, the
following are my favorites for the Second World War:


 Joyce Storey, Joyce's War 1939-1945 (Virago 1992);

   Mary Lee Settle, All The Brave Promises
 (Univ. of South Carolina Press, 1995).



Joyce's War deals with the experiences of a married working-class
British woman during the war and my students liked it.


All The Brave Promises is actually the memoir of an American born woman
who was in the Royal Air Force's women's auxiliary in
the Second World War. It is funny in places, good on class distinctions
[between women as well as men], very well written, and useful if you
wish to focus on the way the war threatened to change gender roles - i.e.,
women in the military.


Hal Smith

I would like to suggest "The Past is Myself," Christabel Bielenberg.  It
is the autobiography of an upper-class English woman who was married to
a German during WWII.  It's a personal account of life in Nazi Germany.
I believe there was a PBS serialization of the book.  I'm sorry, I do
not know if it is out-of-print.


There are so many excellent memoirs by women Holocaust survivors.  Might
I suggest "From Ashes to Life"  Mercury House. 1994 by Lucille
Eichengreen. She has participated in our annual Holocaust Lecture
Series and the book is very well-written.

From Irene Guenther
BlackHound@compuserve.com 06 May 1998


I just taught a 400 level undergraduate course on Women, World War II
and the Home Front: we covered Italy, France (Vichy), Germany, and the
Concentration Camps. The students were always asked after each section
what they felt worked best (I combined scholarly essays with
autobiographical writings so that they could get a sense of each).  For
France, I assigned Code Name Christiane Clouet (by Claire Chevrillon) and
it worked better than Aubrac's Outwitting the Gestapo (which I used last
year). For Germany, Christabel Bielenberg's memoirs have worked well, but
this year I used Berlin Diaries, 1940-1945, by Marie Vassiltchikov (many
of her friends were involved in the July 20th affair).  The students got
much from this book, and the footnotes are very informative and helpful.  For
Italy, I assigned War in Val D'Orcia, an Italian War Diary 1943-1944, by
Iris Origo. It's the best autobiographical book by a woman in wartime
Italy that I've come across (that is readily available through David
Godine Publishers in Boston).  For the concentration camp section, you should
certainly assign Sybil Milton's essay, "Women and the Holocaust: The Case
of German and German-Jewish Women," in When Biology Became Destiny.  For
the autobiographical assignment, the class read Gerda Weissmann Klein's
All But My Life.  There are others, equally moving and filled with
information, but not readily available in paperback.


The debate surrounding German women in the Third Reich is heated and
long-standing.  To get a sense of the Koonz vs. Gisela Bock controversy,
you could assign "Victims or Perpetrators? Controversies about the Role
of Women in the Nazi State" by Adelheid von Saldern in David Crew, ed.,
Nazism and German Society, 1933-1945. For many small autobiographical essays,
an anthology just came out in paperback entitled Beyond the Home Front
(it has WWI and WWII periods covered).


By the way, all of the books mentioned above are in paperback and fairly
inexpensive. Just as important, all of the books mentioned above received
high marks of approval from three separate classes of students.



From O. Sarti   odile2222@aol.com  06 May 1998


Although the book does not pertain to the wars, per say, it is highly applicable to the
time period you will be covering. It is a woman's account of life
under the Stalinist terror. It is written by a woman. The title
of the book is _Journey into the Whirlwind_ by Eugenia Semyonovna Ginzburg.
It is 416 pages long but reads pretty easily.


If you are assessing a book on the Holocaust as well, you might be able to generate some good discussions
comparing life in the various camps in Europe.



From Lee Whitfield  stephen whitfield 110523.512@compuserve.com  08 May 1998


Aleksandra Kollantai's _Love of Worker Bees_ and Marguerite
Duras' _The War_ from the French "La Douleur" have worked really well
in a course I teach on 20th c. Europe. I have the students read Paxton's _Vichy France:
Old Guard, New Order_ together with Duras and it works well.
There are a number of excellent primary documents to use along with these
materials. The films, "Une Affair de Femme" and "Au Revoir les
enfants," students find quite troubling and therefore a
great provocation device for discussion.


[P.S.]...I forgot to include Lucie Aubrac's _Outwitting the Gestapo_ that
includes a thoughtful into. by Margaret Collins Weitz. A personal
memoir, this is likely to appeal to students with its account of day to day
life under the occupation. The other fictional account that i hope to
use in the future would be selections from Ursula Hegge's _Stones From the River,_
a tale revealing the evolution of the grip of Nazism on the daily lives of a small German village.

>From Connie Wawruck-Hemmett wawruck@UWinnipeg.ca  07 May 1998


One book that I think might be very useful is....


_A Revolution of Their Own: Voices of Women in Soviet History_, ed.
Barbara Alpern Engel and Anastasia Posadskaya-Vanderbeck. Westview, 1998.
        

Eight women's stories, based on interviews; particularly focused
on the inter-war period. The format is question/answer, which might or
might not be to one's liking; all in all, however, I think this would be
an excellent addition to any European women's history course.


Also, there is a book written by a man (a journalist), but also based on
interviews with women.....


Bruce Myles. _Night Witches: The Amazing Story of Russia's Women Pilots
in World War II._ Academy Chicago, 1990.

        While I'm not overly fond of the style of this one--there is a
little too much "Vera said....," "Nadia told me....," etc.-- but there is
no doubt that Myles does manage for the most part to retain the
women's "voices" by using this technique. I think it would really grip
the imagination of most students, as it has mine :-)


As for Ginsburg's _Whirlwind....._, it is absolutely excellent, but very
lengthy. Raisa Orlova's _Memoirs_  is not quite so long, but might still
be longer than what you want.



From Yvonne Klein yklein@total.net  07 May 1998


I posted this earlier, but it hasn't yet shown up; apologies if it does
later.
The book mentioned by Irene Guenther, Beyond the Home Front: Women's
Autobiographical Writing of the 2 World Wars is mine and was published
by Macmillan (UK) and NYU.
I have used with success Charlotte Delbo, Auschwitz & After, and can
also suggest Triolet, A Fine of  Two Hundred Francs; Christa Wolf, A
Model Childhood; Marguerite Duras: The War: A memoir.  I am not sure if
Rathbone's novel We That Were Young is still in print in paper, but that
worked very well for home front Britain.

I remember reading a book, possibly in journal/diary form, written by a
White Russian woman who worked in Berlin during WWII who, as time
progressed, became less and less enchanted by the Nazi regime.  This was
about 9 years ago when I had just finished college so  I don't recall
the title but I remember being fascinated by it. Does anybody remember the
title?

        DO NOT rely on the Bruce Myles book for anything more than
entertainment value.  I've interviewed many of the same women and spent
seven years researching this topic. Myles is full of errors; he mixed up
stories with the wrong names, and other parts of the book seem to be
sheer invention. He caught the color of the stories, but unfortunately, not
the facts.


The best published substitute is Anne Noggle's book:

In response to the query of books for Europe, you may also
consult the anthology Mothers of Invention: Women, Italian Fascism,
and Culture, edited by Robin Pickering-Iazzi (Minnesota, 1995) for
compelling analyses of literature, film and the arts produced by
Italian women during Fascism (1922-43).


From Connie Wawruck-Hemmett wawruck@UWinnipeg.ca  11 May 1998


Once more I am struck by the very real benefits of being on a list such
as this one. Thanks so much to Reina for pointing out the problems with Myles book,
and for suggesting alternatives.


And while I'm at it, may I ask for comments on another book which has
caught my interest?


Faye Schulman's _A Partisan's Memoir: Woman of the Holocaust_
I am considering it for a Holocaust history syllabus that I have put
together.



From Ginger S. Frost Ginger.S.Frost@samford.edu  11 May 1998


Thank you to all the people who have given careful
and intelligent suggestions for my class on 20th century
Europe both on the list and off. I now have the pleasant
problem of picking between several good choices during most
of the time period.
        

Some of you asked if I wanted secondary works; I
obviously didn't make this clear in my post and I
apologize. I did want both primary and secondary works, but
please don't feel obligated to write again. On the other
hand, I'll still be thrilled to get any and all advice
about teaching this period (even books about men!).

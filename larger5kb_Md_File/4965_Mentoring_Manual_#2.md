 **1.  Preamble**

The educational philosophy of Le Moyne College is rooted inthe Jesuit
tradition, which endeavors to "educate the wholeperson"--in mind, body and
spirit. At Le Moyne, "educate thewhole person" means that students are given a
solid liberal artscurriculum of required courses, in addition to a
practical,field-specific curriculum of study in their major; that coursesin
all disciplines explore the value-laden dimensions of humanexperience; and
that student involvement in extra-curricularactivities (such as sports, campus
ministry, and volunteerprojects) is viewed as integral to the development of
the wholeperson.

The foundation of Le Moyne's liberal arts education is theCore Curriculum,
required of all students at the College. Exceptfor one natural science and one
social science course, the Coreconsists entirely of humanities courses: 9-12
credit hours inEnglish, 9-12 hours in philosophy, 6-9 hours in history, and
6-9hours in religious studies, spread over a student's four years atLe Moyne.
If you teach core courses, you will have in yourclasses not only humanities
majors, but students from everydiscipline and major the College offers.

Core courses are designed to teach the critical writing,critical thinking, and
analytical skills that will serve studentsin whatever other classes they take
in college, and in whateverdisciplines or professions they pursue following
graduation. Core courses are also designed to assist students in
acquiringknowledge, attitudes, and values that will help them become
goodcitizens of the global community and lead meaningful lives. Asyou design
and as you teach core courses, you must keep theserequirements in mind. Since
elective courses in the varioushumanities disciplines teach the same skills
and kinds ofknowledge, you should consider these skills and knowledge
thefoundation of your teaching at Le Moyne.

You can best put the educational philosophy of the Collegeinto practice in
your courses by creating a supportive ratherthan an adversarial environment
for your students. Because manyLe Moyne students initially lack intellectual
self-confidence,they respond best to a friendly, open classroom atmosphere
thatencourages and supports them as they "learn how to learn." Theyalso need
the requirements for the class to be clearly laid outat the very beginning of
the semester. Once an open, supportiveatmosphere is established and students
gain confidence in theirability to do the work for the course, most students
will performall that you require of them, and often much more. Conversely,an
atmosphere they perceive as hostile or adversarial will causemost of our
students to lose self-confidence and to retreat intosilence and non-
participation. In this case, the needs of "thewhole person" will not have been
met.

 **2.  Teaching**

1\. What sort of students can you expect in your classes?

> _ * Demographics of the student body_

>

>   * Le Moyne students are a relatively homogeneous group.

>   * In 1997, full-time undergraduate enrollment stood at

>   * 1768.

>   * \--74% of students live on campus.

>   * \--94% are from New York State.

>   * \--65% attended public schools.

>   * \--85% are Catholic, 14% Protestant.

>   * \--59% are male, 41% female.

>   * \--95% require financial aid; many choose the

>   * College because its tuition is relatively

>   * low and it is consistently rated in the top

>   * 100 "Best Buys" among colleges.

>   * \--1997 SAT averages are 536 verbal and 542 Math.

>

>

> _ * Academic preparation and skills_

>

>   * The academic preparation and skills of our students vary widely,
especially among first-year students.  For example, some 40 incoming students
a year place out of ENG 100 (College Writing) because they havemet Le Moyne
standards in Advanced Placement or college-level English courses while in high
school. Another 40 students place into ENG 099 (Introduction to College
Writing) as a result of low scores on diagnostic English tests administered to
all incoming students.

>

>

> _ * Typically, Le Moyne students:_

>

>   * are polite, friendly and generally cooperative

>   * are often reticent in class

>   * lack intellectual self-confidence

>   * require a great deal of individual attention

>   * need guidance to become independent learners

>

2\. If you are teaching a 100-level or 200-level course, you should

  * Expect the "lowest common denominator" to be lower than you think. Who won the American Civil War? What is a sonnet? You cannot presuppose that students know these things.
  * Expect to teach study skills, disciplined work habits, and use of the library.
  * Expect to teach grammar, reading comprehension, and close analysis of texts, regardless of your discipline.
  * Expect to teach techniques for writing papers and taking essay exams.

3\. If you are teaching a 300-level course, you should

  * Expect to continue teaching grammar, reading comprehension, and close analysis of texts, because our students profit from constant reinforcement of these basic skills.
  * Not presume that the course number corresponds to its level of difficulty. Note, for example, that in the English Department, elective courses are **_all_**   numbered from 300-399. Thus Basic Studio Operations (CMM 305) and Advanced Studio Operations (CMM 306) both have numbers in the low 300s.
  * Realize that in an introductory 300-level course, you may need to introduce basic vocabulary, concepts, and practices of the discipline or field, as well as provide elementary-level models, worksheets, and exercises. In some courses, you will literally have to teach students how to turn on the equipment they will be operating during the course.
  * Expect that in more advanced 300-level elective courses, students will be better acquainted with the basics of the discipline and will be more independent as learners. Be sure to discuss the course numbering practices of your department with the department chair.

4\. If you are teaching a 400-level course, you should

  * Expect to be teaching mostly fourth-year students capable of considerable independence if nudged. Writing skills, especially grammatical and analytical skills, still need reinforcement.
  * Realize that while most courses with 400 numbers are fourth-year Core seminars open only to seniors, some 400-level courses are Special Topics courses (elective courses on a special topic, offered occasionally). These courses will enroll the same population as the 300-level electives: third- and fourth-year students, with a few second-year students.

5\. Regardless of the level of course you are teaching, there are things you
can and should do to facilitate student learning and develop your own skills
as a teacher.

  * The Academic Support Center can provide valuable assistance to your students. Be sure to alert them to its existence and refer them to various branches of it as you deem appropriate. Services include the Writing Center, the Mathematics Center, and a variety of services for Learning Disabled students.
  * Talk with your colleagues about teaching, covering everything from the larger issues of teaching philosophy to the mundane concerns of test design and syllabus preparation.
  * Study syllabi from previously-taught sections of your courses. Your department chair has files of syllabi.
  * Create a course syllabus that tells students everything that you will require, including due dates. Go over the syllabus with them on the first day ofclass.  
\-- Give this syllabus a great deal of thought; it should be more than a
simple checklist.  
\-- Justify each assignment you make, at least to yourself.  
\-- Be rigorous, but reasonable; don't ask the impossible.  
\-- Make each assignment pedagogically worthwhile, and avoid "busy work."

  * Nurture your students' self-confidence, especially in the first few weeks of the semester.
\-- Accentuate the positive by couching criticism in language that does
notdestroy self- confidence. Encourage effort.  
\-- Expect to _teach students_   how to make meaningful contributionsto class
discussions.  
\-- Never make students feel uncomfortable about asking questions,
particularlyat the beginning of the semester. You can establish a positive
tone (or anegative one) in a very short time.  
\-- Ask students to come in for conferences to review tests and papers with
you. **_You_**  must initiate such communication; don't wait for students to
come to you. Justknowing that you are concerned can build a student's
confidence.  
\-- Learn your students' names as quickly as possible. Students at Le Moyne
areindividuals, never numbers.  
\-- Develop in-classroom strategies to engender peer respect.  
\-- Develop in-classroom strategies to create student ownership of the
classroomenvironment.  
\--Help your students understand behaviors that make professors
uncomfortable:failing to show up for appointments, carrying on conversations
in class, etc.

  * Be creative! Try to do something stimulating, creative, or just a little bit different in every class session. Assign or encourage creative projects or paper topics or class presentations, thus making students partially responsible for the success of the class.
  * Listen to your students. Indeed, ask your students what problems they are having with the course, and listen to what they say. Monthly course assessments are extremely useful; anonymous written assessments work best.
  * Be flexible. If something isn't working, change it. Sometimes your students will have good suggestions about how to modify an assignment or an aspect of the course to improve student performance.
  * Sit in on colleagues' classes. Talk to your colleagues about teaching; gather ideas and try them out.

 **3.  SurvivalSkills**

1\. What do adjunct faculty need to know to survive and thrive?

  * The mail room: where it is, how it operates, what is departmental policy on mailings. Obtain mailbox assignment and key in mailroom.
  * Photocopying facilities and the Print Shop: locations and policies. Obtain faculty photocopying card from department chair.
  * See department chair to obtain office key and faculty computing room key.
  * See Security Office to obtain parking sticker for faculty parking lot.
  * Secretarial help and Work/study assistance: what is available, and when.
  * Computer assistance, including use of the VAX for the professor and for class work.
  * Library facilities, including Inter-Library Loan.
  * Bookstore policies and charges.
  * Audio-Visual services.
  * Registrar's Office: Blue books, Scantron forms, chalk, whiteboard markers, grade books.
  * Variable Grading Program for personal computers.
  * Use of Recreation Center.

2\. Remember that Le Moyne is a very small place. Everyone knows everyone
else, and a great deal of departmental business is conducted informally.

  * Expect your teaching life to be an open book.
  * Expect any comments made to a student (in a conference, on a paper, in class, after class, in your office, or in strictest confidence) to be a matter of public record among the student population before nightfall.
  * This means that any exception made for a single student will probably have to be made for all students.

3\. When in doubt, ask questions. Colleagues, support staff, _and_ _students_
will be happy to help.

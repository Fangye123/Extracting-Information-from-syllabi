**Textbook**  
| _Introduction to Discrete Mathematics through the Analysis of Puzzles and
Games_ , D. E. Ensley and J. W. Crawley, Shippensburg University, 2001. You
will need to purchase a three-ring binder to hold this and other course
materials.  
**Course Information**  
Title | MAT 225, Discrete Mathematics  
Description  | This is a curious mathematics course in that it has a
theoretical flavor, meaning that "abstract thinking" is central to the course,
and yet it is an application-oriented mathematics course, meaning that we will
develop mathematical tools as needed to solve specific problems. The moral of
this story is that it is often the abstract nature of mathematics that allows
it to correctly model and solve real-world problems. One catch with this
particular book is that often the first applications we will see are
mathematical puzzles and games. After studying the mathematics behind these
"recreational" problems will we then apply it to everyday applications, many
of which come from the field of computer science. I will allow the preface of
the text to come to the defense of the study of puzzles and games.

The course covers the typical topics for discrete mathematics including
combinatorics and recursive modeling, probability and matrix arithmetic, and
graph theory and logic circuits. You will notice that the text is still being
written, so I would appreciate all of the comments and criticism you can
muster about the text. I appreciate your patience with this "draft edition",
and I hope that we can all enjoy the journey of refining and improving the
material together.  
Location  | Tuesdays and Thursdays in MCT162  
**Course Requirements**  
General expectations | Information and material for this course will be
distributed in class, through e-mail, and on the course web page, which can be
reached from <http://www.ship.edu/~deensl/>.  The class will meet in MCT 162,
a computer classroom. On many days, the students will actively explore
discrete math concepts using on-line resources, the computer algebra system
_Maple_ , or hands-on activities. The active construction of mathematical
ideas is essential to the learning process, so it is very important to attend
class everyday.  To this end, a daily attendance record will be taken, and
this information will be used for some extra credit at the end of the
semester.  (If you have a documented excuse for an absence, you will be
counted as present for this purpose.)

You will be expected to keep a notebook containing your attempts at all
assigned problems. The weekly homework that is handed in will be very similar
to these problems, so trying all of the assigned problems will be time well
spent.  Notice that the homework accounts for about 17% of your overall grade,
so it is very important for you to do problems outside of class to succeed in
this course.

As part of your course portfolio (see below), you will also be expected to
attend one at least extracurricular campus event pertaining to math, computer
science or another technical area. The department web page
<http://www.ship.edu/~mathcs/> contains a list of department events for the
semester.  All other events must receive my approval.  
Graded material | The following components of the course contribute to your
final grade:

  * Weekly homework, collected on Thursdays, average scaled to 50 points. 
  * Two midterm exams, each worth 60 points. Tentatively scheduled for February 19 and March 28. 
  * One writing assignment, tentatively due on March 7, worth 20 points.
  * Comprehensive final exam, 80 points. 
  * Final [Course Portfolio](http://www.ship.edu/~deensl/m225/portfolio.html), due at the end of the semester, 30 points.

  
**Grades**  
|  Letter grades for this course will be determined using the following scale:  
  | **Points (300 possible)** | **Letter**  
---|---  
270 - 300 | A  
265 - 269 | A-  
255 - 264 | B+  
240 - 254 | B  
235 - 239 | B-  
225 - 234 | C+  
205 - 224 | C  
175 - 204 | D  
**Policies**  
Late work | Students are responsible for submitting required problem sets and
taking exams on the assigned dates.  
If an exam is missed in the event of personal emergency, the student must
notify the instructor within 24 hours after the exam date to make proper
arrangements. Only in the event of a documented illness or emergency will a
makeup be given.  _I will not accept late homework._ A student who misses a
class in which a homework assignment is given should get a copy of the
assignment from the professor, another student in the class, or from the class
web page. A student who misses a class in which a homework assignment is due
should give it to the professor outside of class on or before the due date,
send it to class with a classmate, or e-mail it to the professor on or before
the due date. _One homework grade will be dropped at the end of the course._  
Additional policies  | All students identifying themselves as having special
physical or learning needs will be accommodated. Please see me early in the
semester if this applies to you.  
**Other Advice**  
Virtual Office Hours  | Wednesday, 9:00 - 10:00 pm, in the Chat Room on this
site. This is not an "official" office hour since the technology occasionally
fails. For this reason, I suggest that you do not exclusively depend upon this
method of communication.  
Study Strategies | The Mathematics and Computer Science Department provides
free walk-in tutoring in MCT258. (See the bulletin board outside of MCT250 for
a current schedule.) Many students have found that an excellent way to succeed
in math classes is to work on homework problems in or near this room during
this time so that there is help available as questions arise. This same
strategy can work effectively simply by forming study groups and setting
regular times to meet and do problems. This format encourages regular out-of-
class work on math problems, probably the most important single factor toward
success.

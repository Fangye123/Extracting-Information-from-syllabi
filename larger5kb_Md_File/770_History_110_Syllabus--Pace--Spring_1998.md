Return to Table of Contents  
  

### Attendance Policy:

Attendance in the class is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Because much of the
information in this class comes from lectures, absences will place the student
significantly behind, therefore, attendance records will be kept. If a student
arrives after roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to make sure
his or her presence has been recorded AT THE END OF THAT DAY'S CLASS. If a
student's absences, both excused and unexcused, equal 25% of the class days
(that means eight classes), the student will automatically fail the course (no
questions asked).  
  
Make-up Policy: Make-up exams will be administered only when students can show
a valid reason for their absence (this means confirmation from either the
health center or from the dean). Students must schedule the make-up exam with
the instructor within one week of the original exam. Failure to make such
arrangements will result in failure of the course.

### Research Paper:

**Assignment:** You are to write a five-to-seven-page research paper on a
topic concerning Western Civilization from the seventeenth century to the
World War II era. The paper should include a title page (with paper title,
student name, course name and number, and instructor's name), five to seven
pages of text, an endnotes page (or pages), and a works cited page. Note that
the title page, endnotes page, and works cited page do not count as part of
the five to seven pages. All papers are to be typed double space on a word
processor and printed with standard ten-pitch fonts (Courier 10 preferred) and
margins (1 inch). All pages, excluding the title page, should have an Arabic
(1, 2, etc.) page number at the top right corner. The first page of text
should have an Arabic "1" at the bottom center of the page. All papers should
be saved to disk in at least two separate locations (hard disk and floppy, two
floppies, etc.), so that a new copy may be immediately printed in case the
original hard copy is misplaced.  
  
**Topic:** You should look through the Tierney and Scott book for essays that
interest you and choose your topic from those essays. These essays are primary
sources and highly valued in all historical research. Therefore, you are
required to use these sources as the starting point for choosing a topic. Your
topic may relate to a person, a group, an institution, a trend, a movement, or
an idea. Your topic could concentrate on change or continuity; it might focus
on comparisons and contrasts.  
  
This assignment is not a report!!! Soon after you begin your research, you
must decide what questions about your topic you intend to answer. Otherwise,
not knowing exactly what you want to find out, you will waste valuable time
pursuing interesting but unrelated topics and have no paper in the end.
Significant historical questions frequently seek cause, effect, motivation,
relationship, nature, meaning, significance, or structure. State your question
as simply as possible and use it to guide your research and to structure your
material for writing.  
  
**Sources:** You are required to use at least four sources in gathering your
information. Your first source will be the Tierney and Scott book. List only
those sources most likely to contain information on the question you want to
answer. Do not get all of your information from one or two sources and try to
"fluff up" the works cited page with other works you think might apply. You
may not use your text book (the Perry book). Find your information in
scholarly sources, such as books with extensive notes and an extensive
bibliography, or books published at university presses. You can even get your
information from scholarly historical journals. Evidence of your research must
be reflected in your endnotes. Please do not use any electronic media,
including the Internet for a source. The only exception to this rule is if you
find a primary source on the Internet, **BUT YOU MUST SHOW ME THIS SOURCE AND
RECIEVE MY PERMISSION BEFORE YOU USE IT.**  
The type of material that must be documented (i.e. endnoted) includes:
controversial or distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are not a
matter of broad general knowledge (most facts are not part of broad general
knowledge), statistics, all quotes, and paraphrases or summaries of an
author's argument. All direct quotes over fifty words in length must be
indented and single-spaced as described in the departmental style sheet. You
should have at least one endnote per full page of text (typical papers have at
least one endnote per paragraph).  
It is imperative that you document source material, but the _argument or
thesis of your paper must be in your own words_ : excessive use of quotes or
lengthy paraphrasing of sources will not be accepted, and leads easily to
plagiarism. On plagiarism, see below.  
  
**Prospectus:** After choosing your topic, you must write a one-page
prospectus about the topic and your intended areas of research. The prospectus
should be no more than a page in length and should contain the following
information:  
_Topic_ : general description of the topic.  
_Hypothesis_ : What you believe you will be able to prove or disprove about
the topic.  
_Research questions_ : a list of at least three general questions about the
topic you will use to guide your research.  
_Probable sources_ : A list of at least four sources (not including Tierney
and Scott) that you believe will help you in your research (again, no
encyclopedias, text books, or electronic media).  
The prospectus is due on Wednesday, January 28, 1998, at the beginning of
class. This assigment will not be graded but five points will be taken off the
paper grade for every day the prospectus is late (including weekends and
holidays). _**All papers not turned in at the beginning of class will be
considered one day late.**_  
  
The Term Paper is due on Wednesday, March 4, 1998, at the beginning of class.
All papers not turned in at the beginning of class on that day will be
considered one day late. Five points will be deducted from the paper grade for
every day it is late. **_Wednesday, March 18, 1998, is the absolute deadline
for the paper. If a student fails to turn in his or her paper by this date, he
or she will automatically fail the class._**  
  
**Research Paper Grading** : The research paper will be graded according to
the following categories and with the the following weight given to each
category:  
1) Historical Analysis and Thesis (thesis argued, analytical contributions,
depth of understanding and insight)--30%  
Points will be deducted in this category if you present more of a report than
a term paper that argues specific points about your topic. Points will also be
deducted if the arguments you choose are the obvious ones that do not require
much analysis on your part.  
  
2) Amount of Research (adequate sources, supportive evidence to defend thesis,
etc.)--30%  
Points will be deducted in this category if you do not adequately support your
thesis with historical information or analysis. Points will also be deducted
in this category if you fail to use the required number of sources or if any
of the sources you use are not scholarly. Points will also be deducted in this
category if you produce less than five full pages of text.  
  
3) Form (typing, pagination, endnotes, works cited page, quotations,
spelling)--20% Points will be deducted in this category for the following
problems: if you have numerous typographical errors or if your pagination does
not follow the instructed guidelines; if your endnotes or works cited pages do
not follow the proscribed format; if you provide some factual information for
which you cite no source (technically, this is plagiarism); and if there are
any problems with quotation form, spelling, or punctuation.  
  
4) Writing Style (how well the information was conveyed, introduction,
conclusion, grammar, etc.)--20%  
Points willl be deducted in this category if there are problems with your
introduction, conclusions, topic sentences, transition sentences, or general
sentence structure. Points will also be deducted if you use too much passive
voice; make your verbs active.

### CORRECT FORM FOR TERM PAPERS

Students should NOT use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do NOT use parenthetical notes!! Only footnotes and endnotes will be
acceptable! Please consult Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_. 6th ed.  
  
Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a term paper.  
  
The following are some useful examples from Turabian:  
  
Footnoting a book:  
  
    **1 Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London: George Allen and Unwin, l938), 33.**

  
  
If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,  
  
    **2 Ibid., 37.** (Note that Ibid. is not underlined)  
  
If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,  
  
    **17 Waley, _The Analects_ , 130.**  
  
Footnoting an article or selection in an edited anthology or book of readings:  
  
    **3 Klemens von Metternich, "Political Confession of Faith," in Brian Tierney and Joan Scott, eds., _Western Societies: A Documentary History_ , 2 vols. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984), 2: 239.**  
( _Note that in the above example, the number of volumes in the book appears
after the title and the specific volume from which the citation came appears
before the page number at the end._ )  
  
If a different article or selection is cited from the same anthology, students
should use the following form:  
  
    **9 Thomas Malthus, "First Essay on Population," in Tierney and Scott, eds., _Western Societies_ , 2: 144.**  
  
  
Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
  
Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
  
    **3 Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ , vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization_ , ed. John W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, l986), 402.**  
  
Footnoting a Review:  
  
    **4 Steven Spitzer, review of _The Limits of Law Enforcement_ , by Hans Zeisel, in _American Journal of Sociology_ 91 (November l985): 726-29.**  
  
Footnoting a Journal:  
  
    **8 Don Swanson, "Dialogue with a Catalogue," _Library Quarterly_ 34 (December l963): ll3-25.**

     **10 Michael Norman, "The Once-Simple Folk Tale Analyzed by Academe," _New York Times_ , 5 March l984, p. l5**  
  
Bibliography: Your bibliography should be entitled "Works Cited," and it
should only include works which you have cited in your footnotes/endnotes.

#### PLAGIARISM:

Students should be reminded that the use of an author's ideas in a student
paper without giving proper credit to the author constitutes plagiarism.
Likewise the use of an author's words without placing those words in quotation
marks and providing proper citation is plagiarism. Students sometimes believe
that by changing an occasional word or two or even three in a sentence or
paragraph, they are avoiding plagiarism. This is not the case! The information
and ideas taken from a source must be re-formed into your own words! And after
re-forming it into your own words, you must use a footnote or endnote giving
proper credit to the author.  
  
If your instructor suspects intentional or unintentional plagiarism, your
paper will be returned ungraded and you will be asked to bring your sources to
his office to verify the scholarship.

### REVIEW DISCUSSIONS

On three occasions during the semester (see course schedule), all students
will be grouped in the class for a review discussion over the Tierney and
Scott readings. There will be three groups, and each group will lead one
discussion. On the day that the group is assigned to lead, all members of the
group will receive the same grade for discussion leadership. Group members are
encouraged to meet separately before the discussion to create a list of open-
ended discussion questions over the Tierney and Scott book. Good questions
will generate discussion; bad questions will not. Good questions typically
seek to understand the underlying issues in a given essay; they seek to reveal
what the author was feeling and thinking when he or she wrote the essay; they
seek to understand what was written in relation to other events of the time,
etc. Time will not allow a full discussion of all readings assigned from
Tierney and Scott, so it will be up to the group to decide which readings are
most important for the discussion. Everyone in the class will receive a
separate grade for participation in these discussions. If a student has an
excused absence on a discussion day, the instructor will give that student a
separate writing assignment to make up for the missed discussion.

### FINAL EXAM QUESTIONS

The final examination in this course will include one of the following
cumulative essay questions. Students should keep these questions in mind
during the course of study over the semester.  
  
1\. Create a thesis that discusses the causes of four wars that occurred
between 1618 and 1945.  
  
2\. Discuss the role of foreign policy in consolidating domestic control. Use
five examples from Modern Western Civilization to illustrate your points.  
  
3\. Compare and contrast the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution.
Include discussion of causes, actions, and results.  
  
4\. Compare absolutist philosophy and activity of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries to totalitarian philosophy and activity of the twentieth
century.  
  
5\. Compare and contrast the leadership styles, significant actions, and
influence of four of the following: Louis XIV, Frederick the Great, Catherine
the Great, Maximilian Robespierre, Napoleon Bonaparte, Clemens von Metternich,
Camillo di Cavour, Otto von Bismarck, Joseph Stalin, and Adolph Hitler.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  

### Grade Posting:

I will post exam grades on the door to my office for all students who wish to
learn their grade before I give the exams back to the class. If you would like
your grades to appear on this list, you must supply me with a four-digit
number that you can remember, and your grade will be posted next to that
number. Choose a number that has little opportunity of being duplicated (no
1111 or 0000).  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  

### Honor Code:

Because trust and integrity are integral parts of an academic environment and
decent society, all work in the course will be your own. Write out and sign
the honor pledge when you hand in papers. (I have neither given nor received
any help on this test nor am I aware of any infraction of the Honor Code.)  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  

### Bibliography:

For students wishing to do additional reading, a comprehensive bibliography
appears at the end of each chapter in your text.

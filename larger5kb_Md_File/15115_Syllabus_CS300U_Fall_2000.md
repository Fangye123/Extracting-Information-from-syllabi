Course Objectives.

**

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will have gained an
increased awareness of the relative impact that the technological development
of the digital computer has had and is expected have on society. The primary
focus will be on the problems posed by and benefits offered by computers.
Students will research areas of computers in society along with the
technological hardware advances and the software that are used in the systems.
Students will explore the applications of computers in education, government,
business, transportation, medicine, and the home. The secondary focus will
evaluate the impacts of computers on personal privacy, constitutional issues,
computer crime and fraud, and the importance of studying reliability and
encryption. The views and opinions of all students will be presented in open
forum discussions on specific topics. The students will be partly responsible
for the "current events" component of the lectures. The text focuses more on
the problems and their possible solutions in relation to the secondary focus.
We will utilize other resources to augment the benefits portion of our
discussions.

Course Limitations.

**

The subject area of "Computers in Society" is so vast that CS 300U can do
nothing more than scratch the surface. We will aim for breadth rather than
depth in the lectures and for depth rather than breadth in the forum
presentations and written assignments. We will strive to strike a balance
between a systematic approach and a current-events dominated approach. Current
event presentations will begin each class period, and may consequently drive
each lecture. However, we will utilize textbooks to keep us on course for a
broad exposure to the issues to be addressed.

In addition to the required text, supplements from the World Wide Web will be
utilized. The instructor's web page contains copies of the syllabus, project,
and forum descriptions. It also contains copies of the presentation slides
used in the lectures and a list of useful URLs.

Course Requirements.

**

Each class will include a discussion of current events concerning computers
and their impact on the related societal topic. It is expected that students
will contribute significantly to this discussion. Information may be found in
any of the following areas, but is certainly not limited to them: newspapers,
magazines, television, and the Internet. As this is an important part of the
class, participation in this segment will form a portion of the final grade.

Weekly reading will be assigned from the Dushkin text. Students are required
to prepare a summary of one article, to be assigned each week. The summaries
will be based upon predefined topics that will apply to each assigned article.

Each student will complete a project that will consist of a final paper. The
project must address issues relevant to the spectrum of course topics.

Students will be placed into groups of 3 or 4 students to prepare a forum
presentation, which will summarize salient issues relative to a given topic.
The intent is to educate the class and incite class discussion.

There will be three tests. These will consist mainly of guided essay-style
questions pertaining to topics addressed in the lectures, readings, and forum
discussions.

Course Policies.

**

Read the [Classroom Rules](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~price/rules.txt). (Some
items are NOT applicable to TV classes.)

If the course project is not turned in on the due date or tests or the
presentation dates are missed, a grade of **ZERO** will be assigned for the
missed grading element unless the instructor has given permission. Any student
who fails to perform in a satisfactory manner on the course project may
possible not pass the course regardless of the student's overall point total.

Because the class period is important and discussions cannot be reproduced,
absences cannot be made up. Excessive absences may have a negative effect on a
student's learning and performance. Any student who must miss a class is
expected to have the initiative necessary to properly cover the material
missed (i.e. assignment given or modified, due dates established or modified,
any handouts, etc.). Students must meet all course deadlines.

#####  

#####  Dimensions of Literature is the required course for English majors. Its
central objective is to develop your ability to analyze literary texts through
extensive reading, analysis, and writing. In this course you will develop your
understanding of how various formal elements of a literary text work together
to produce meaning, how texts relate to one another and to larger social,
historical, and ideological contexts, and how literary analysis is shaped by
various assumptions and conventions. In addition to our recitation section
each week, you will be required to attend the course lecture before class on
Wednesdays and to complete weekly assignments in response to the issues
covered there.

##### Because this is a writing-intensive course worth 6 credit hours, I will
expect you to complete the equivalent of two courses' worth of reading and
writing for each week of the course. You will have a writing assignment due
almost every week. We will not have class the night before Thanksgiving, but
you will be responsible for turning in a paper by Monday, Nov. 26. I urge you
to consider carefully whether your other commitments this semester will allow
you adequate time to keep up with the work in this course. English majors must
earn at least a C in ENGL 325 course to fulfill their major requirements.
Successful completion of ENGL 325 satisfies the Writing Intensive course
requirement for English majors.

#### Requirements:

##### Pre-requisites for this course include two 200-level literature courses
or their transfer equivalents.

##### I expect you to attend all class meetings, to complete all reading
assignments in advance of class, and to be prepared to participate in class
discussions, exercises, and quizzes concerning them.

##### You will need access to e-mail and to the Internet and will need to
register for the Town Hall discussion list. You will need to know how to send
documents as attachments to e-mail messages. You may access the Internet from
any on-campus terminal. Students dialing up from home will need their own
Internet Service Provider to connect to non-GMU sites.

##### You will be required to attend a performance of _Nathan the Wise_ ,
performed on campus by the Theater of the First Amendment. Some free tickets
will be available for students, but you must commit early to get one for the
performance you want. See the separate handout for details.

##### I follow the GMU Honor Code and expect you to do the same. For a
description of the Honor Code, see
[http://www.gmu.edu/facstaff/handbook/aD.html.](http://www.gmu.edu/facstaff/handbook/aD.html)

5 % Weepers Reading (due Sept. 19)  
12 % Point of View Essay (second draft due Oct. 3)

##### **Paper Policies** : In addition to several shorter writing assignments,
you will write four essays of 4-5 pages each. Two of these will have required
first drafts, which I'll comment on but not grade. All paper drafts must be
typed double-spaced with 1-inch margins. All drafts are due at the start of
the class for which they are listed on the syllabus. Late drafts will be
penalized 1/3 grade per day. Drafts are late after the first 10 minutes of
class; drafts left in my mailbox in the English Department are counted as
late. I will accept drafts as e-mail attachments, but only to certify that you
made the deadline; you are still responsible for giving me a hard copy within
48 hours of the paper deadline (Exception: you may submit the _Othello_ essay
by e-mail attachment only). You may revise your essays after receiving a
grade. I will average the grade on the re-write with the original paper grade
to arrive at your final grade for that assignment. I will not accept revised
papers after our last class meeting (December 5).

##### **Lecture Responses:** For most weeks, I will assign follow-up questions
for the Wednesday night lectures. These questions will be posted on my website
by noon Thursday; your responses will be due by noon on the following Monday.
You may submit responses via e-mail or turn in typed versions to my mailbox in
the English Department. Lecture responses should be at least 250 words,
whether submitted typed or via e-mail.

#####  Final Examination: We will have an in-class final examination on
Wednesday, Dec. 12, 7:30 to 10:15 p.m. It will include some short answer
objective questions on various analytical issues covered in the lectures and
in our discussions. It will also include a practical section in which you will
be asked to apply what you have learned in the course to one or more literary
texts.

##### Participation and Quizzes: I expect you to be present for all classes
and to be prepared to contribute to class discussions and other exercises.
Since you cannot participate if you do not attend class, two absences or more
may lower your participation grade by as much as 50%. Quizzes may be given at
any time and may not be made up. As part of your participation grade, I will
require you to post at least three comments to the Town Hall online discussion
group for ENGL 325 during the course of the semester.

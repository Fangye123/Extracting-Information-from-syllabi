### Message from the Chair

Dickinson College

Newsletter for the Section on Statistical Education  
Volume 7, Number 2 (Spring 2001)

* * *

Summer may be considered "down time" for education, but that is definitely not
the case for activities of our Section.

The primary illustration of this is the program that our Section will offer at
the Joint Statistical Meetings in Atlanta in August. Jim Matis has assembled
an excellent series of sessions on a wide variety of themes, and John Holcomb
has organized a set of roundtable discussions that promises to be quite
informative. Details about this program can be found elsewhere in this
newsletter. In addition to urging you to attend these sessions, I also
encourage you to watch for sessions related to education that are sponsored by
other sections and organizations.

Summer is also a time in which many teachers engage in professional
development. ASA's newly created Advisory Committee on Teacher Enhancement
(ACTE), on which I sit as the representative of our Section, is working on a
series of initiatives to improve teachers' preparation to teach statistics.
One of these is a plan to conduct summer workshops combined with distance
education courses for high school teachers; a grant proposal has been
submitted to NSF for this project. Another initiative is the planning of a
conference specifically addressing issues of teacher preparation in
statistics. A third is to work more closely with the National Science Teachers
Association to improve the teaching of statistics in science courses.

Another important summer project is a planning meeting to be held at Ohio
State in July to consider establishing an Institute/Consortium for
Undergraduate Statistics Education. The goals of such an institute would
include facilitating the exchange of ideas among instructors of undergraduate
statistics and promoting statistics education as both a career path and a
research area. Deb Rumsey and Joan Garfield are the organizers of this
meeting, at which I have been invited to represent our Section. They and I
welcome your thoughts about the potential of this organization.

Since statistics education is becoming prevalent throughout the K-12
curriculum, I encourage all Section members to consider ways to make a
positive impact on this important enterprise. Summer vacation may provide an
opportunity to make contact with local teachers of statistics. A professional
statistician might invite a high school class to take a field trip to her
company and explain what her job entails. A college professor might share
teaching materials with an AP Statistics teacher. An AP Statistics teacher
might offer to advise students working on science fair projects. A graduate
student might visit a high school class and describe what appeals to him about
studying statistics. This list just scratches the surface of possibilities,
but I hope that it inspires you to consider how to use your knowledge and
interest in statistics to help with the teaching of our discipline.

Before I conclude this column I want to thank ASA's outgoing executive
director Ray Waller as he approaches his retirement, for Ray has been a
committed advocate for statistics education. He and his wife have made a
generous donation to ASA that they have designated to support statistics
teachers at the beginning of their careers, and they have entrusted our
Section with overseeing awards from this endowment. On behalf of the Section I
thank Ray for his service and wish him well in retirement.

**Finally, I invite you to attend our Section's Business Meeting and reception
to be held from 5:30-7:00 on Wednesday, August 8 in Atlanta. I look forward to
seeing you there.**

The Better File Cabinet [ (http://betterfilecabinet.
com)](http://betterfilecabinet.com) is a free searchable database of
references to research in math and statistics education (nearly two thousand
as of May 2001). The MAA's Special Interest Group collected the references on
Research on Undergraduate Math Education (SIGMAA on RUME) and references on
Statistics Education were collected by Joan Garfield. Using the web interface,
the references are searchable by author, title, full text, and keywords and
there is an ongoing effort to add commentary on the papers.

The site is in a very usable state, but it is still a preliminary beta
version. Consolidation and cleaning of the keywords is planned for the near
future, as well as a number of other new features. There is also a sister
database of calculus problems that will eventually be expanded to other topic
areas and integrated into a database containing both research papers and other
educational resources.

Anyone wishing to contribute time, references, ideas, or resources to the
project is encouraged to contact Eric Hsu

Newsletter for the Section on Statistical Education  
Volume 7, Number 2 (Spring 2001)

* * *

This past fall the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) published a new
book in its Notes series called "Teaching Statistics: Resources for
Undergraduate Teachers." The book is a collection of classical and original
articles on statistics education along with descriptions of several of the
innovative and successful projects that have been recently developed along
with "companion pieces" on these projects that give pointers on their use from
teachers who have used them in the own courses. The goal of the volume is to
provide beginning and experienced teachers with practical help on getting more
data into their courses, using alternative teaching and assessment methods,
and using electronic resources for teaching.

Newsletter for the Section on Statistical Education  
Volume 7, Number 2 (Spring 2001)

* * *

On Sunday, August 5, I will be offering a workshop on "Teaching Statistics
with a Baseball/Sports Emphasis". This workshop describes the content of a
recent introductory statistics course I taught at Bowling Green State
University from a baseball perspective. One goal of the class is to make
statistics fun by teaching the material in the context of baseball. This class
is taught to students who are genuinely interested in baseball, but may not be
familiar with many of the common baseball statistics that are used to rate
hitters and pitchers. The topics of this course include data analysis for one
and two variables, elementary probability, and topics in statistical
inference. I'll describe special features of the course, including comparison
of teams and players, and simulation of games by means of tabletop games.
Although the focus of the workshop is on baseball, I will discuss a number of
datasets and associated activities for other sports such as basketball,
football, and soccer. Resources for teaching sports statistics class are
outlined, including data sources on the Internet and courses taught at other
universities. See my web site
[(http://math-80.bgsu.edu)](http://math-80.bgsu.edu) for lecture notes from
the class I taught last fall.

### MAA Has Special Interest Group for Statistics Education

Newsletter for the Section on Statistical Education  
Volume 7, Number 2 (Spring 2001)

This is an open letter to anyone and everyone who has an interest in the
wellbeing of statistics education, and announces the Mathematical Association
of America's (MAA's) new Special Interest Group on Statistics Education, or
'SIGMAA on Stat Ed.' If you read this newsletter chances are that you are a
statistician in a statistics or mathematics department. However, you could be
a mathematician in a mathematics department who teaches a lot of statistics,
or maybe has been 'born again,' and one of your primary interests is
statistics education. You could be a high school teacher involved with the
Advanced Placement test for Statistics. Whoever you are, I want to tell you
about the SIGMAA on Stat Ed.

As many of you may know, some ten years ago in August of 1991, the Isolated
Statisticians met for the first time at the Atlanta Joint Statistical Meetings
(JSMs). The meeting was organized by the Statistics in the Liberal Arts
Workshop (SLAW), and moderated by Jeff Witmer of Oberlin College (SLAW
member). It was primarily for statisticians who were isolated from other
statisticians by nature of their being the only, or one of two, statisticians
in a mathematics department. Also in attendance were statisticians from
statistics departments who were sympathetic to the difficulties of the
isolated statistician's existence. The 'IsoStaters' have continued to meet at
the JSMs, usually with 40 attendees discussing issues related to teaching
statistics and to being an isolated statistician. Since then there have also
been many regional conferences for isolated statisticians. The benefits reaped
by the isolated statisticians at their annual and regional meetings were so
positive that Tom Moore of Grinnell College (SLAW moderator) and Don van Osdol
of the University of New Hampshire had an idea. Why not have a meeting of the
mathematicians who teach a lot of statistics, or who are interested in
statistics education, at the Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMMs) in January of
each year?

So, in the summer of 1997 that they asked me to organize and moderate such a
meeting, and at the JMMs in Baltimore in January of 1998, the first Isolated
Teachers of Statistics Meeting (ITSM) was held. Over 40 attendees discussed
issues related to being the only, or one of very few, instructors in the
department who cares about statistics education. The 'IsoTeaStaters' met again
in January of 1999 at San Antonio.

At about this time the MAA was developing the concept of Special Interest
Groups (their counterpart to an ASA Section). There were other interest groups
meeting regularly at the JMMs as well. Involved with this task force was Allan
Rossman of Dickinson College, Chair of the ASA/MAA Joint Committee on
Undergraduate Statistics), and like myself, an IsoStater and IsoTeaStater.
Before the January 2000 JMMs the concept of a SIGMAA became official, and
Allan drafted a charter for a SIGMAA on Statistics Education. With the help of
yours truly and my co-organizer for the January 2000 ITSM, Mary Sullivan of
Rhode Island College, we 'slickened' it up and presented it to the
IsoTeaStaters at the 2000 ITSM. At that meeting the IsoTeaStaters discussed
whether we wanted to become a SIGMAA (and voted 'yes'), made suggestions to
improve the draft charter, and in fact voted to dissolve upon acceptance of
the charter for the SIGMAA on STAT Ed by the appropriate MAA committees.

Last June saw the end of the 'IsoTeaStat-ers' and the beginning of the
official SIGMAA on Stat Ed. Over the fall, when MAA members were asked to
renew, they had the option of joining two SIGMAAs. At the 2001 JMMs this
January in New Orleans, at the inaugural SIGMAA on Stat Ed business meeting, I
was happy to announce that we had 170 dues paying members! Also at the meeting
we discussed outreach to groups such as the NCTM, AMATYC, the AMS, and all
teachers of statistics in mathematics departments at the high school or
college level. We discussed liaisons with the ASA's Stat Ed section and
appropriate committees with the NCTM, AMATYC, CUPM, the IASE, and statistics
educators in other disciplines. We bounced around ideas for our newsletter,
our web page, and what we wanted for benefits. We even 're-elected' our
charter slate of officers for 2001 (hey, we didn't really exist until we got
money ... uh ... members). I am the Chair, Mary Sullivan is Chair Elect,
Ginger Holmes Rowell of Middle Tennessee State University is Secretary, K.L.D.
Gunawardena of U.W.-Oshkosh is Treasurer, and Allan Rossman is Past-Chair for
the second year running! We have a Webmaster and three volunteers do edit the
newsletter!

Of course we talked about a lot of 'big plans' at our inaugural meeting, and
it will take time to get everything off of the ground. Yet we already have
volunteers to liaison with AMATYC at their annual meeting, and with one of its
very active regional 'sections.' Another person will try to organize a SIGMAA
meeting at MathFest this summer (although he doesn't know it yet!). It also
became clear how complicated it will be just assigning the various duties that
the officers will have. However, as I look upon the upcoming year with
excitement (and some trepidation!), I feel very positive about our future. To
quote from our mission, I think that for many years to come the SIGMAA on Stat
Ed will 'provide a forum through which those interested in statistics
education can meet, interact, exchange ideas, provide support for each other,
and foster increased awareness of statistics education.' Hey! If you are not a
member of the MAA I invite you to join (remember, a huge percentage of all
statistics courses are taught in mathematics departments). And if you are an
MAA member, then joint the SIGMAA on Stat Ed today!

### New Graduate Programs in Statistics Education

Joan Garfield  
University of Minnesota

Newsletter for the Section on Statistical Education  
Volume 7, Number 2 (Spring 2001)

* * *

Many of us are aware that the number of courses in introductory and
intermediate statistics is steadily growing. At the college level, there are
now more sections of introductory statistics than sections of calculus. At the
High School level, there are over 40,000 students in Advanced Placement
Statistics courses, and those numbers are steadily rising. Despite the
increase in statistics courses, there is currently no formal preparation for
the teaching of statistics. Many statistics teachers at the high school level
have bachelors or master's degrees in mathematics or mathematics education,
and may not have taken an applied statistics course, worked with data, or used
a statistical software package. At the college level, most teachers of
statistics lack formal training in becoming a teacher of statistics.

Over the past two decades much interest has been paid to first courses in
statistical science. Calls for reform have made recommendations about how the
teaching of these courses should be improved, to increase student learning and
attitudes towards statistics, and to develop a statistically literate society.
This reform movement has greatly affected the teaching of the introductory
statistics course, updating the content, placing more of an emphasis on data
analysis using real data and simulation, including material on designing
experiments, sampling, and surveys as ways of collecting and producing data,
and incorporating the use of technology (both software and web resources) as
an integral part of the course.

There is also a need to attract and prepare more people to the field of
statistics, which has led to the ASA's Undergraduate Statistics Education
Initiative. One focus of this initiative is the first course in statistics,
and a recommendation from the working group on this topic is to develop
programs to better prepare teachers of statistics. To help meet this need, a
new master's and doctoral program in Statistics Education (as well as a Ph.D.
minor) will be offered at the University of Minnesota, beginning in Fall
2002\. This program will be housed in the Research Methodology area within the
Department of Educational Psychology.

All students in the new programs will be expected to develop their knowledge
of areas related to statistics education as well as methodological
competencies. A teaching internship will allow students to apply what they
learn to the classroom setting and receive supervision and feedback on their
teaching. The research requirement for the master's thesis or doctoral
dissertation will prepare the students to conduct high quality educational
research applied to the teaching and learning of statistics, and to link the
results of research to classroom practice. Among the research competencies
students develop are: critically analyzing a body of literature, generating
research questions which address specific issues in statistics education,
developing empirically-based tests and surveys, designing and executing
educational studies, analyzing and interpreting research results (utilizing
both quantitative and qualitative data), and succinctly communicating in
writing and in oral presentation the results of research studies.

Two new courses are being developed for students in the new programs. One is a
seminar on classic and current research in statistics education, while the
other focuses on practical aspects of becoming a teacher of statistics. The
supervised teaching internship will allow students to apply their knowledge of
research on how students learn statistics and of current resources and
recommendations for teaching first and second courses in statistics. For more
information, please contact Joan Garfield at
[jbg@umn.edu](mailto:jbg@umn.edu). She would like to hear from faculty at
other institutions who might be contemplating starting their own masters
and/or doctoral program in statistics education.

Volume 7, Number 2 (Spring 2001)

* * *

The Educational Statisticians Special Interest Group (SIG) of the American
Educational Research Association (AERA) is a group of over 200 researchers
interested in statistics as applied to educational, behavioral, and social
problems. Members of the SIG include statisticians, academics in departments
affiliated with education, psychology, or statistics, measurement experts from
testing companies, publishing houses, and research organizations, researchers
from a variety of educational organizations, and others interested in the
promotion of sound statistical practice in education and other settings.

This year the Educational Statisticians SIG sponsored nine sessions as part of
the annual meeting of AERA, held from April 10 to 14 in Seattle. Four of the
sessions featured short paper presentations highlighting current research in
the areas of experimental design, multiple-comparison procedures, equivalency
testing, effect size analysis, statistical modeling, factor analysis, survey
research, and bootstrapping. Two symposiums offered participants a chance for
more in-depth learning and discussion of highlighted topics. One of these
symposiums focused on issues in handling missing data in statistical analysis
and the other highlighted perspectives on teaching applied statistics. Two
roundtable discussion sessions on teaching educational statistics and issues
in statistical methodology allowed participants a chance for small-group
discussions with the authors of papers. A highlight of the meeting was the
invited address given by Erich Lehmann. Professor Lehmann spoke on the topic
of nonparametric methods in a presentation titled, "The Assumption of
Normality: Should We Trust It? Do We Need It?"

The ISI (International Statistics Institute) established a committee in 1994
to stimulate the spread of quantitative skills around the world in areas and
populations (especially in developing countries and among the young) that
could benefit from increased knowledge of numbers and their applications, with
particular regard to statistics. The committee was chaired by Prof. Luigi
Biggeri (Italy). Under his chairmanship some very concrete successes were
realized.

In 2000, it was decided that this Project would now come under the umbrella of
the IASE (International Association for Statistical Education), an arm of the
ISI. I have agreed, as a major portion of my sabbatical year, to work on the
development of a working plan for the World Numeracy Project. If time permits,
I will also begin on the implementation of this plan once the IASE officers
and the ISI Council approve it.

My first step in developing the World Numeracy Project is to gather
information from as many people as possible as to what directions they want
the World Numeracy Project to take. In order to do this, I need anyone reading
this article to give me suggestions as to what tasks the World Numeracy
Project should undertake. Below does Professor Biggeri chair a list of
possible ideas that were given in various reports from the ISI Committee? You
may use this list as a starting point for your thoughts. But, what is also
very important to me is to have people give me ideas that are NOT on this
list.

LIST OF IDEAS FROM FORMER ISI COMMITTEE ON THE WORLD NUMERACY PROGRAM

  1. Promotion of national numeracy programs 
  2. Production of a TV series 
  3. Survey of International Statistical Training efforts 
  4. Survey of National Statistical Training efforts 
  5. Register of International Statistical Standards 
  6. Hall of fame of great Statisticians 
  7. Museum of Numbers 
  8. Developing a code and/or booklet on correct data collection procedures 
  9. Addressing the needs of teachers, media, and journalists 
  10. Addressing the needs of national and local governments 
  11. Promoting a World Statistics Day or World Statistics Month 
  12. Assisting with the development of national and international training efforts in statistics 
  13. Assisting with the development of national and international training efforts in the teaching of statistics and numeracy. 

Please send your ideas and comments to me by mail or email at the addresses
given at the beginning of this article. If you wish to contact me by telephone
or fax, my telephone number is (507) 457-5589 and fax number is (507)

Do you teach an Introductory Statistics course? Do you teach AP Statistics?
Would you be interested in some new ideas for making the course more
meaningful to the students?

"Beyond The Formula" is a two-day conference in August designed specifically
for the mathematics teacher teaching introductory statistics whether it is in
high school or college, whether a first time or experienced teacher. Several
of the speakers are very involved in the AP program.

Fifth Annual BEYOND THE FORMULA - "Introductory Statistics for A New Century:

The Journal of Statistics Education (JSE) began the new millennium with a new
editor and a new look on the World Wide Web. I was appointed editor in January
2001, succeeding the founding editor, Jackie Dietz, who had served for eight
years. Jackie deserves all the credit for making JSE what it is today.

JSE has grown from publishing via email distribution in 1993 to a fully linked
Web version in 2001. We installed a new "look" to the Web site beginning with
the May 2001 issue. We tried to make the site even easier to navigate without
compromising the appearance and quality of the articles.

In August 2000 the American Statistical Association (ASA) Board of Directors
voted to make JSE free, as it was when Jackie Dietz founded it in 1993.
Although subscription fees are no longer required to access JSE articles, we
have not lost the ability to automatically maintain an email distribution list
of subscribers. If you would like to sign up at no cost to receive electronic
notices of new issues of JSE, please send me an email and I will add you to
our distribution list.

Another change in 2001 is the availability of banner and button space for
advertisements on the JSE Web site. The ASA has been very supportive of JSE
since it became an official ASA journal, but it would be ideal if JSE could
become self sufficient through funds raised by advertising. If you are
interested in placing an ad on the JSE Web site, please contact me or Claudine
Donovan [(claudine@amstat.org)](mailto:claudine@amstat.org) at ASA for more
information.

We will publish at least two more issues in 2001. Parts of the July issue are
already installed on the JSE Web site. The July issue will include articles by
Dex Whittinghill and Bob Hogg on "A Little Uniform Density With Big
Instructional Potential," by Robert Bordley on "Teaching Decision Theory in
Applied Statistics Courses," by Chris Malone and Chris Bilder on "Statistics
Course Web sites: Beyond syllabus.html," and more. The final regular issue of
2001 will appear in November.

We also plan to publish a special issue in late 2001 or early 2002 that will
include articles from sessions at JSM 2001 and the 2000 AERA meeting. These
articles will be accompanied by discussions contributed by leading statistics
educators.

Thanks to the JSE Editorial Board, we are handling a steady flow of
submissions from all over the world. We can always use more excellent
articles, so please consider writing an article relevant to statistics
education and sending it along to JSE.

Please continue to read JSE, to give feedback on what you read, and to
consider sharing your own ideas and expertise with JSE by submitting an
article.

Thank you for your readership and for your support of JSE!

### Recent PhD's in Statistics Education

Joan Garfield  
University of Minnesota

Newsletter for the Section on Statistical Education  
Volume 7, Number 2 (Spring 2001)

* * *

Statistics Education is a relatively new discipline that is growing in
interest and activity. People conducting researches in statistics education
come from a variety of different areas and often have very different
backgrounds, coursework, and training. Over the past year I became interested
in learning more about graduate students who have decided to pursue degrees in
statistics education. I conducted email interviews with eight current doctoral
students and recent PhD's whose dissertation research focused on statistics
education. I wanted to learn about their coursework, their training in
research methods, and the topic of their dissertation study. I was also
interested in finding out the nature of their experience designing and
completing a degree that focused on statistics education. These eight
individuals shared with me their reflections on the process of earning a
doctoral degree in statistics education and offered advice to future graduate
students interested in pursuing this path.

Through word of mouth and personal contact, I obtained the names of these
eight individuals who had recently graduated or were in the dissertation
process, and all agreed to be interviewed. Each individual has a different
story about how they came to be interested in statistics education, how they
designed a program that would allow them to develop the expertise needed to do
a dissertation in this area, and how they were able to complete the
requirements and overcome obstacles along the way.

The names of the people interviewed, where they did their graduate work, and
their dissertation topics, are listed below:

  * Sarah Abramowitz, Department of Mathematics Education, New York University. Dissertation: "Comparison of Achievement and Attitudes of Introductory Statistics Students" 
  * Barb Barnet, Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. Dissertation: "Comparison of Hands-on Activities to Computer-simulated Activities" 
  * Jane Brandsma, Department of Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education, North Carolina State University. Dissertation: "Data Collection and Analysis: Examining Community College Students' Understanding of Elementary Statistics Through Laboratory Activities" 
  * Lee Creighton, Department of Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education, North Caroline State University. 
  * Mark Earley, Department of Educational Research and Measurement, University of Toledo. Dissertation: "Investigating the Development of Knowledge Structures in Introductory Statistics" 
  * Sara Finney, Department of Educational Psychology (Qualitative and Quantitative Methods), University of Nebraska. Dissertation: "A Comparison of the Psychometric Properties of Negatively and Positively Worded Questionnaire Items" 
  * Jenenne Geske, Department of Educational Psychology (Qualitative and Quantitative Methods), University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Dissertation: "The Structure of Introductory Statistics Knowledge: An Investigation Exploring Students' and Experts' Cognitive Organization Using Multidimensional Scaling and Pathfinder Analyses" 
  * Jackie Miller, Department of Statistics and College of Education, The Ohio State University. Dissertation: "The Quest for the Constructivist Statistics Classroom: Viewing Practice Through Constructivist Theory" 

Most of the people interviewed came to statistics education because of their
experience teaching statistics. Many expressed their enjoyment teaching
statistics, but also expressed a concern over difficulties students have
learning statistics, solving statistical problems, and using statistical
thinking, which led them to study and pursue research in this area. Only one
person chose this area because of her advisor's research interests. Two people
indicated that they specifically planned to teach statistics at the college
level and thought that this degree would best prepare them.

These eight individuals entered graduate programs in statistics, mathematics
education, or educational psychology programs. Based on their experiences, it
appears to be somewhat easier to design a statistics education focus within a
mathematics education department than in other departments. Many students
outside of mathematics education either had to combine programs (e.g.,
statistics and education) and have co-advisors, or switch advisors to find one
that approved of a dissertation in statistics education.

One interesting distinction between students in the three different areas has
to do with the type of job preparation they receive. Most mathematics
education programs are focused on teacher education (i.e., teaching those who
will prepare math teachers) while the combined programs of statistics and
education are focused on training individuals to be teachers of statistics
themselves, typically at the college level. Students in Educational Psychology
are prepared to teach quantitative methods (to graduate students in Education)
and to conduct research in the area of educational statistics.

The coursework taken by these people varied according to the type of
department they were in. For example, students in Educational Psychology
programs took mostly courses in that department (e.g., statistics,
measurement, and learning) and were less likely to take courses in mathematics
education. Students in mathematics education programs appeared to have more
varied programs with courses in educational psychology and statistics in
addition to mathematics education. Several people found their coursework in
psychology or learning and cognition to be the most helpful in preparing them
to do research in statistics education, while others noted their coursework in
statistical methods was particularly valuable. Most of the students across
programs valued preparation in both quantitative and qualitative research
methods.

Getting a dissertation topic approved was often a hurdle, and a few students
experienced reluctance from their advisor to agree to a focus on a statistics
education topic, feeling that this would limit their job possibilities. In the
cases where students had co-advisors, getting approvals from two advisors and
two departments was often challenging and took extra time. Most of the people
interviewed were the first person to design a statistics education program and
dissertation. One person commented: "My biggest obstacle was that since no one
had done this before I was on my own for a lot of it in deciding what courses
I should take and what an appropriate dissertation looked like."

Being connected to the wider statistics education community via meetings and
newsgroups has been very helpful to many of the people interviewed. One person
commented "I would especially like to acknowledge how wonderful the statistics
education community has been about welcoming me into the fold. I have met some
terrific people and made some great connections and look forward to continued
work with these people."

Others wish there could be more recognition of and validation for statistics
education as a legitimate area for study and research. "As more students
pursue degrees in statistics education it is important to identify faculty
members as advisors who have comfort and expertise in both fields, education
and statistics." "While looking for a job, I was asked a few times what
exactly a statistics education degree was. I had the most success in answering
this question by saying that it was like a mathematics education degree."

Those who have finished degrees are teaching in a variety of settings, and
appear quite satisfied with their decision to focus on statistics education.
One person remarked, "I am very happy I chose the field I did. My teaching and
my research feed off each other, which is very meaningful to me... I'm excited
by the 'newness' of the field. There are so many directions in which we can go
and I am happy to be near the beginning of that exploration."

Since conducting these interviews I have learned of at least two other
graduate students, both in departments of mathematics education, who are
working on dissertations focused on statistics education. These studies
examine middle school or high school teachers' knowledge and understanding of
statistics, an emerging area of interest to statistics education researchers.
With more formal programs in statistics education beginning to be developed
(see the article on the new program at the University of Minnesota in this
newsletter) the statistics education community should begin to provide a more
consistent and complete training to prepare and support future teachers and
researchers in this emerging discipline.

### Statistics Education at the ASA

The increased emphasis on statistics in the K-12 curriculum, the strong
interest in the high school Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics courses, and
the increased need for statistics in a wide range of occupations, prompted the
American Statistical Association to promote the enhancement of undergraduate
education in statistics. The Symposium on undergraduate statistics education
held at JSM 2000 was the focal point for the development of the 'Curriculum
Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science', which were
approved by the Board of Directors in December. [These can be seen on Amstat
Online.] These Guidelines set the stage for exciting advances in undergraduate
statistics education that can be built around the key points of flexibility,
innovation, and experimentation in the content and structure of courses.

The undergraduate initiative is just one of many being planned for the ASA's
Center for Statistics Education (CSE). This Center should be positioned to
play a leading role in the unfolding emphasis on statistics throughout the
K-12 mathematics and science curriculum, as well as in the undergraduate
curricula of colleges and universities. To accomplish this, the CSE is
attempting to establish clear goals and guidelines for promoting statistics
education at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, and at various
levels of undergraduate activity, including the preparation of future teachers
of mathematics and science. At all these levels, improving the skills of
teachers is the overarching goal, although the undergraduate initiative goes
beyond that. Objectives toward these goals should include intensive workshops
for teachers at all levels, sessions at professional meetings of statistics
and allied societies, special conferences on aspects of statistics education,
innovative use of the web, and serious networking among educational and
scientific groups.

Organizationally, the group responsible for the oversight of most K-16
educational programs funded through ASA is the Advisory Committee on Teacher
Enhancement (ACTE), chaired by Robert Stephenson. This Committee includes
representatives from the Section on Statistical Education and the joint
committees that relate to NCTM and MAA. That it is a very active Committee is
shown by the fact that it received ASA strategic initiative funds for four
projects on which it is now embarking. These are outlined below.

  1. Planning for a Conference on Statistics in Teacher Preparation Programs. In an attempt to impact the preparation of future teachers of mathematics and science, this project will bring together statisticians and those involved in pre-service teacher preparation to plan a conference on how to better prepare future teachers to present the ideas and methods of statistics.

  2. Planning for Web Infrastructure to Support ASA Educational Programs. The Quantitative Literacy (QL), Science Education and Quantitative Literacy (SEAQL), and Data Driven Mathematics materials provide a rich resource for K-12 teachers of mathematics and science. Planning for use of the web to better promote and disseminate these and other materials, and related information on statistics education, is the purpose of this project.

  3. Planning a Funding Request for New AP Statistics Teacher Training. The explosive growth in the number of students taking the Advanced Placement Statistics Exam means that more and more high school teachers with little or no background in statistics are being called on to provide statistics instruction. This initiative will support the writing of an NSF proposal to develop a course (both through workshops and web-based materials) on statistical content for first time teachers of AP Statistics. Such a course can build on the success of the current Beyond AP Statistics workshops.

  4. Planning for an Institute for Undergraduate Statistics Education. Following up on the efforts to advance undergraduate statistics education, as mentioned above, this project will lay the groundwork for creating an Institute for Undergraduate Statistics Education. Such an Institute will be a consortium of colleges (including two-year colleges) and universities working together under ASA guidance to provide innovative enhancements and structures to undergraduate statistics education. The institute will eventually prepare and disseminate materials for statistics educators and researchers. The Institute will serve as a resource and clearinghouse for best practices. It will facilitate the exchange of information among the various groups of faculty members (e.g. statisticians, mathematicians, two-year college faculty, social scientists) who teach undergraduate statistics.

Much of the descriptive material above comes directly from the proposals
written by the ACTE, as does the following, which summarizes the philosophy of
ASA as we embark on exciting new efforts to enhance statistical thinking and
practice in the world.

"One can argue that the best ambassador for the statistics profession is a
well-trained and enthusiastic teacher of statistics. ... If we are to enhance
the prestige and influence of the statistics profession and assure that
statistics is taught correctly and with an appreciation for its utility, we
must provide opportunities for the enhancement of teachers at all levels."

### The Star Library is Ready for Launch!

The STAR Library is a new peer-reviewed Statistics Teaching And Resource
Library on the WWW (web address: <http://www.starlibrary.net>). It was created
to support and encourage statistics teachers in their efforts to include
hands-on activities in their courses, and encourage those who have not yet
tried using activities, to do so. The focus at this point is the introductory
course(s) in undergraduate statistics, although in time, we may expand our
focus. All activities on the STAR Library are freely available for use by
anyone. They are categorized according to topics on a typical introductory
statistics syllabus, and can be sorted by amount of time needed, whether the
activity is in/out of class, and whether it requires a computer. Activities
can be downloaded and edited for easy customization, and can be accompanied by
a variety of technological supplements (e.g. digital photos, video
demonstrations, spreadsheets and datasets).

Why was the STAR Library created? While most of us agree that incorporating
activities in the classroom is important, there are many reasons why
statistics teachers don't use them as often as they would like to. Some of the
obstacles are logistic-how do we find high quality teaching activities? While
each of us has a few really great ideas, there is little opportunity to share
and exchange our ideas with others, resulting in an easily exhausted
repertoire. Many commercial products are available such as workbooks and CD-
Rom, but not everyone has the financial means to purchase these products. Even
if we do, it is often hard to adapt the activities in these commercial
products to our own situations, classes and teaching styles.

The STAR Library addresses these issues. Its mission is to promote and
encourage active learning in statistics classrooms in a way that makes it easy
for teachers to participate. The four main objectives of the STAR Library are
to provide a collection of teaching activities for statistics that is 1) of
high quality; 2) easy to access; 3) free of charge; and 4) easy to customize.

STAR takes advantage of the accessibility of the WWW, but also its wide range
of available technologies. This allows authors to demonstrate their activity
without the constraints of a regular print journal. Teachers not only read the
activity, and about the activity, but can then can see digital photos, or
video demonstrations of the activity actually being carried out in a
classroom. With regards to video, the STAR Library has a Real server, which
can stream Real video files. (The editors will work with authors who create
videos in other formats.)

STAR Library also offers teachers a wide range of materials and information
beyond a description of the activities themselves. For example, each activity
has a "prototype". This prototype is a "ready to print" handout that can be
given directly to students. If an educator prefers to edit the prototype
before handing it out, a Word version of it can be downloaded. Any data,
spreadsheets, JAVA applets, or computer programs provided by the activity's
author are easily assessable and can be downloaded by the user. Attached to
each activity is a message board that allows educators to discuss an activity.
Topics for discussion can include comments on how the activity went in class,
ideas for changes or additions to the activity, or suggestions from authors
regarding how to use the activity. It is our hope that these features will
increase teachers' confidence and comfort level with the activities and
incorporate them into their classrooms more often.

STAR Library has an editorial board; each activity is refereed by at least two
people for quality, purpose, clarity, and attention to the format. The peer-
reviewed nature of STAR serves two purposes; first, it ensures the quality of
the activities, but equally important, it provides a publication outlet for
teachers that recognizes teaching scholarship. And because STAR focuses solely
on activities rather than research, a high quality activity can be as short as
1-3 pages long. A quick turnaround in the electronic environment within which
STAR operates is also helpful for authors. The STAR Library will not have
"issues" like most journals. Instead, the STAR Library will publish activities
as soon as they are accepted in order to provide a quick dissemination to
educators.

Many statistics teachers (and perhaps many students) have come to think
activities are fun to do, but that they don't really help move the class
forward in terms of learning the concepts to be covered in class (in other
words, they tend to take up too much time). A high quality activity should
integrate the statistical concept in a way that makes class time productive;
it should work with the teacher to help students learn, not work against them,
competing for time. This really brings into play the importance of learning
objectives and assessment regarding activities. The STAR Library pays great
attention to quality and completeness of activities, both from a student and a
teacher perspective. In addition to a "prototype" or student version of each
activity, there is a teacher version of the activity, written as a brief
paper, that maintains a certain structural format. Each teacher version
includes an abstract, a clear objective, list of materials/time needed, a
description of the activity, a paragraph on assessment, and teacher notes on
what to expect when carrying out the activity in your classroom.

Another important feature of the STAR Library is what's New? The What's New?
webpage lists the activities recently published in STAR Library. Educators can
also sign up for monthly emails, which describe what's new so that they do not
need to check the web page on their own. Other important features of STAR
Library include the Tour, which gives a short tour of the website and help on
how to use it. The Chat Room web page provides a forum for future scheduled
chat sessions between educators, editors, and authors to discuss statistics
education. All of these web pages are easily assessable from the STAR Library
navigation bar.

The grand opening issue of the STAR Library is currently being posted on the
STAR Library website. Some of the activities you will find there include:
"Counting Eights: A First Activity in the Study and Interpretation of
Probability"; "Does Practice Really Make Perfect?" which applies a matched
pairs experiment to Frisbee and golf distances; "Random Rendezvous" which
examines probability issues revolving around meeting a friend for a lunch
appointment; "Simulating Size and Power using a 10-sided Die" which
illustrates size and power issues through simulation; "Breaking the Code - A
Graphical Exploration Using Bar Charts" which engages students in an encoding
activity, and an experiment to compare the absorbency of two brands of paper
towels ("Which Paper Towel is More Absorbent?").

This grand opening issue of STAR Library is just the beginning. To make it
successful, we need more activities! We hope you will consider submitting one
of your favorite activities for possible publication in the STAR Library for
all of us to share. To view the author guidelines, simply go to the STAR
Library website (<http://www.starlibrary.net>) and click on "Submit." Videos,
digital photos and other supplements are encouraged but not required for
publication. Authors retain copyright of their published articles; we only ask
that you submit an original activity, and that you not submit an activity that
has already received a copyright somewhere else without permission of the
publisher.

The STAR Library has been made possible through grants and support from
Duxbury Press, Oklahoma State University, and Kansas State University. The
Editor of STAR Library is Deb Rumsey ([rumsey@math.ohio-
state.edu](mailto:rumsey@math.ohio-state.edu)), and the Chief Associate Editor
and Webmaster is Christopher Bilder
([bilder@okstate.edu](mailto:bilder@okstate.edu)). If you would like further

International Affairs U4735  
Environmental Science for Decision Makers

Syllabus \- Fall 2000

_Professors_ : Steve Rayner, James Simpson, Peter deMenocal and Walter Pitman.  
_Teaching Assistant_ : Jeff Shaman.  
_Lecture_ : TR 2:40 - 3:55p.m; Room 407 IAB.  
_Recitation_ : to be arranged Tu or Th at 4:10 p.m.

Approach will be lectures, discussions, assigned readings, and problem sets on
specific topics which address three central themes of current environmental
policy issues:

  1. Water,
  2. Climate,
  3. Energy.

Examples will include issues for which considerable divergence of opinion
exists about the underlying physical data/observations and what the most
effective policy options are. This one-semester course will follow a modular
format whereby the scientific foundations of a given environmental policy
issue are presented, followed by an in-depth analysis of the relevant
scientific/policy controversy, then concluded with discussion of how these
controversies might be resolved. Lectures/discussions will be led by one staff
member from SIPA and three staff members from the Department of Earth and
Environmental Sciences, with a short exam and problem sets assigned for each
of the three segments of the course. Materials covered will include a range of
time and space scales, from those primarily relevant to particular river
systems (ie. Indus & Yangtze Rivers) over a few decades, to topics of global
significance on the time-scale of the next century or more (climate change and
energy). Our primary goal is to present simple, first-order quantitative
approaches to understanding natural environmental processes as one category of
analytical tools applicable to public policy decisions. A companion, optional,
one point tutorial, available to all registered students in U4735, will pursue
similar topics and issues through more extensive problem sets. This tutorial
is highly recommended for all SIPA students & required for undergraduate
students receiving science requirement credit for U4735.

#### Grading Guidelines

**

Course grade (3 Points) based on 25% for each in-class plus final exam and 25%
on problem sets. One point tutorial will be evaluated independently and the
grade for this component averaged (25% of total weight) with that for the
lecture portion of the course (75% of total weight).

#### General Course Goals

Many environmental problems are inherently international and they all may have
some impact on public policy. The demands of increasing human populations for
earth resources and the concomitant generation of waste stresses a variety of
earth systems. Assessment of complex interactions between nonrenewable
resource use, pollutant generation and renewable resource contamination
requires understanding of a number of natural systems of the Earth's
environment and their sensitivity to a variety of stresses.

Although you can expect to learn some specific factual information about
several subjects in environmental science during this course, probably the
most important result of participation should be to gain confidence in
analyzing the dynamics of the natural world on your own, especially through
simple, order of magnitude calculations.

**Biology Through Art Syllabus**

[Instructor: Dr. Hunter O'Reilly, Ph.D., Artist &
Geneticist](http://www.uwp.edu/academic/biology/bioart/hunteroreillybio)

This course teaches biology and the scientific method through the creation of
innovative artworks in the laboratory. Students view microorganisms, use DNA
as an artistic medium, create music based on DNA sequence and see anatomy as
art. The course culminates in students creating their own genetic self
portrait.

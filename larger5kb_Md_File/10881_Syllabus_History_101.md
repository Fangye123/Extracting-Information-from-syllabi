### A. _Course goals:

_** This course introduces undergraduates to the basics of U.S. history for
the period from the end of the Civil War to the 1990s. Particular emphasis is
given to furthering students' "cultural literacy" -- that is, their exposure
to subject matter of importance -- rather than to student self-expression.
Besides learning from large lectures, small-group discussions, and assigned
reading, all students will participate in the exploration of relevant
historical information located on the World Wide Web (WWW).

Students will be expected to acquire a minimal level of computing literacy in
the course. Toward that end, instructors will spend some time early in the
semester introducing students to the Internet and to the use of WWW browsers.
There are presently millions of pages of primary historical sources (texts,
videos/films, oral "testimony," and graphical images) on the Web. Each day,
thousands more appear. Learning how to access and use these electronic
documents is an important skill -- one that all educated people should
acquire.

Computers with Web browsers (specifically Netscape) will be available to
History 101 students in LC-15; we will announce the schedule to the room in
class. There are other sites around campus with Netscape-loaded computers and
we will let you know where and when you can use them when we meet. Those of
you who already have a computer and modem will be able to access the WWW on
your own schedules.

* * *

**

### B. _Attendance:

_** Each week of classes includes two lectures, given Tuesday and Thursday in
Lecture Center 20, and one discussion session, held on either Friday or Monday
in Ten Broeck 1 or 2. Students are expected to attend all three classes each
week. Attendance will be taken. If any student has more than four unexcused
cuts during the semester, his or her course grade will be reduced by one point
(for example, from B- to C+). Valid excuses must be grounded in written
documentation of a medical or personal emergency.

* * *

**

### C. _Grades:

_** Each student's grade will be based on four separate evaluations: two
midterm exams, a final exam, and a discussion grade. Each will count 25
percent of the course grade. Exams will be based on both lectures and reading.
Special credit may be given for dramatic improvement between the first exam
and the third. Discussion grades will be based on oral participation, quizzes,
and special Web project assignments.

* * *

**

### D. _Academic integrity:

_** The discovery of cheating on any exam or plagiarism on any project paper
will result in immediate expulsion from the course with a failing grade and a
report to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.

* * *

**

### E. _Lecture Center behavior:

_** While in class students may not read, whisper, doze, pass notes, or engage
in any other type of disruptive behavior. The risk is a complete loss of
temper by the lecturer. All students must be seated on time (that is, before
the lecture begins); latecomers may be turned away at the door. Permission
ahead of time is required for any student who must leave class early.

* * *

**

### F. _Readings (paperbound books to purchase)

_**

**Three "period" novels:**

  * **Stephen Crane, _Maggie: A Girl of the Streets_ (1893).**  

  * **Norman Mailer, _The Naked and the Dead_ (1948).**  

  * **Marilyn French, _The Women's Room_ (1977).**  

**Textbook:**

  * [Example 1: Original Scanned Informant's Report Sent to the Lusk Committee](LCJ19-19.GIF). This document is directly drawn from Prof. Gerald Zahavi's research on labor and radicalism in America. It, and the ones that follow, profile post-WWI radicalism in Broome County, New York. Broome County radicals were a divided lot in late 1919. This division--shared by many of their comrades across the nation--reflected the strength of ethnic and national chauvinisms, the general crisis in American socialism precipitated by World War I, and the impact of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. The vast majority of the County's radicals were right wing socialists, but there was also a substantial pro-Bolshevik left-wing. Local socialists were organized into a number of foreign language federations -- Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Russian, and so on. This document is a report on pro-Bolshevik Lithuanians active in Binghamton N.Y. [Source: N.Y. State Archives] 
  * [Example 2: Original Scanned Informant's Report Sent to the Lusk Committee](LCAU5-19.GIF). An informant's report on a recent Socialist Party meeting in Binghamton. It was written by Julia Preston, a _Binghamton Press_ reporter fluent in a number of East European languages. Preston, a right-wing socialist who detested pro-Bolshevik left-wingers, attended many local socialist meetings. Little did her comrades know that she was sending regular reports on their activities to the state legislature. Preston identified herself in her correspondence as agent 100. [Source: N.Y. State Archives] 
  * [Example 3: Original Scanned Informant's Report Sent to the Lusk Committee](LCJA5-20.GIF). Here's another report by Julia Preston (agent 100), this time with a fascinating profile of the cultural world of Slovak radicals. [Source: N.Y. State Archives] 
  * [Transcribed Versions of Informants' Reports and Correspondence Sent to the Lusk Committee](lc-typed.html). Here are more informant reports, this time from A. Adomaitis, along with correspondence from the Chief Investigator of the Lusk Committee and Binghamton attorneys responsible for relaying the reports to the Committee. 
  * [Selection from 1921 FBI File on Broome County, NY Radicals](FBI1921.html) A fascinating account of religious conflicts, Endicott radicals, and George F. Johnson, head of the Endicott-Johnson Company. E-J was a shoe manufacturing firm with plants in Endicott, Johnson City, and Binghamton, N.Y. 
  * [Red Scare, Broome County, I](BPN14-19.GIF). An article in the _Binghamton Press_ from 1919, illustrating the erosion of civil liberties during the red scare years. 
  * [Red Scare, Broome County, II](BPD1-19.GIF). Two articles from the _Binghamton Press_ from 1919. More examples of the erosion of civil liberties. 
  * [The Edge Trimmers and the Patriarch](trimmers.html). Endicott, NY (1927). A transcription of a conversation between the head of the Endicott Johnson Corporation and a group of employees. The Endicott Johnson Corporation instituted paternalistic practices in the 1890s. Under the direction of George F. Johnson, the company became a quintessential practitioner of both corporate and community welfare capitalism by the 1920s.

This course examines alternative theoretical perspectives on the most
important issues involving the international political economy of North/South
relations. In Part I of the course, we will consider five different
theoretical approaches to the subject, beginning with the liberal-
internationalist views that predominate in the U.S. and continuing with
consideration of their conservative critics, as well as the views of
structuralist writers, dependency theorists, classical Marxists, and
poststructuralists.

In Part II of the course, we will examine the historical development of major
issues, policy controversies and strategies considered by both rich and poor
states during the postwar era. We will begin with the principal international
development issues of the 1950s, the terms of trade debate and the logic
behind international aid efforts. Next, we will consider the promise of
foreign direct investment in the 1960s and will examine the expansion and
consequences of multinational corporations. We will then discuss the
differentiation of the Third World through the emergence of the NICs and the
success of OPEC, paralleled by the demands for a New International Economic
Order. The 1980s were the decade of structural adjustment, the politics of
which will be analyzed in some detail, beginning with the origins of the
global debt crisis, and continuing with a discussion of the ensuing
stabilization and adjustment programs, the political economy of reform, and
the relationship between economic and political liberalization. Finally, in-
depth attention will be paid to the issues that currently dominate the
international development scene: the environment, population and family
planning, hunger, grassroots organizations, etc. We will conclude with a
consideration of the new international context of development, including the
new organization of production.

* Stephan Haggard and Robert Kaufman. _The Politics of Economic Adjustment_. Princeton, 1992. 
* Mitchell Seligson and John Passe-Smith. _Development - Underdevelopment. The Political Economy of Inequality_. Lynne Rienner, 1993. 
* Michael Todaro. _Economic Development in the Third World_. Longman, 5th Edition, 1994. 
* Peter Uvin. _The International Organization of Hunger_. Kegan Paul, 1994.  **Optional:**
* Stephen Krasner. _Structural Conflict_. California, 1985. 
* Cynthia Enloe. _Bananas, Beaches and Bases_. California, 1990.  These books, along with the supplemental readings listed on the syllabus, will be available from the Reserve Desk at the Rockefeller Library. A packet of the supplemental readings will also be available, if students wish to make their own individual copies for personal use.

Students taking the course for credit will be required to complete two papers
of modest length, the first of 10 pages (accounting for 25% of your final
grade) and the second of 15-20 pages (accounting for 45%). There will also be
a take-home final exam (accounting for 30% of your final grade). In the first
paper assignment, students will be asked to write a critical review of a
recent book concerned with international aspects of development. Because the
instructors of this course believe that an ability to express ideas clearly
and succinctly is one of the most important attributes of an educated
individual, this course will participate in the peer tutoring writing program.
Thus, it is imperative that all papers be completed by the assigned dates. The
first draft of the first paper will be due to your peer writing tutor
Thursday, February 23\. The final, revised version of the first paper will be
due on Thursday, March 9.

In the second paper assignment, students will be asked to write a short
research paper that puts the arguments of one of the theories or policy
prescriptions to an empirical test. Students are required to use electronic
sources of information for this paper; they will be trained in class in how to
employ the Internet as well Brown library's electronic search facilities. The
first draft of the second paper will be due to your peer writing tutor on
Tuesday, April 11. The revised draft of the second paper will be due on
Tuesday, April 25.

The take home final exam will be handed out on the first day of the exam
period, and due on the examination date that will be scheduled for the course
(to be announced).

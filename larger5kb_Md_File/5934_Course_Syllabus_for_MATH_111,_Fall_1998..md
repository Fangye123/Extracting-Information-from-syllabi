###  Course Description:

Math 111 satisfies the Core Curriculum requirements in computation and
computer literacy. It is an introduction to the breadth of the fields of
applied mathematics and an introduction to the use of computers to support
this field. The use of spreadsheet software is integrated with problem solving
using topics from: probability and statistics, consumer math, discrete
mathematics, modeling and simulation and operations research.

###  Prerequisites:

  * Level II placement on Basic Math Skills Inventory; or 
  * MATH 099; or 
  * permission of the department. 

###  A realistic assessment of course requirements:

This course requires a substantial amount of work using computers. You are
encouraged to use the College's lab facilities, but you may use your own
computer and software resources if they are the same as we use in class. You
must learn to budget your time to allow for lab assignments, and you need to
develop a sense for when you are stuck and need help.  
  
This course requires you to manipulate data and algebraic expressions. You
will need to work with variables representing both actual items of data as
well as yet unspecified values. My goal is to help you see that you can do
mathematics, and that mathematics is a part of much of what people need to do
in today's society.

###  Goals & Objectives:

  * Goal 1:  |  The student will feel confident in her or his ability to do math problems and to use a computer.   
---|---  
Objective:  |  All assignments will be completed with a grade of 75 or better.  
  * Goal 2:  |  The student will understand Polya's problem solving method.   
---|---  
Objective:  |  In a closed book exam, the student will write a paragraph
describing each step. The student will describe in her or his own words the
step's purpose in problem solving.  
  * Goal 3:  |  The student will be able to: (1) manipulate numeric and non-numeric information using the computer as a tool, (2) use organizational techniques such as directories in DOS, (3) define and interpret descriptive statistics including but not limited to minimum, maximum, range, mean, median, mode, correlation coefficient, (4) read, interpret, and analyze data presented in graphic form, (5) set up and apply procedures for solving various applied math problems using the computer as a tool, (6) solve multi-step problems which require more than rote application of techniques, and (7) present the analysis and solution of a problem in an organized and clear fashion in writing.   
---|---  
Objective:  |  All of these are assessed through homework assignments; (7) by
completion of problem solving assignments.  
  * Goal 4:  |  The student will acquire knowledge of sampling techniques, estimation, and graphical presentation of data, sufficient to enable her or him to read critically technical information presented in the media (TV, magazines, journals, books, etc.)   
---|---  
  * Goal 5:  |  The student will begin to formulate an effective problem solving approach that can be used in the Arts and Sciences.   
---|---  

###  Required Texts:

  * _For All Practical Purposes: An Introduction to Contemporary Mathematics (Fourth Edition)_ , W.H. Freeman and Company, 1996. 
  * _For All Practical Purposes: Interactive Study Guide (Fourth Edition)_ , W.H. Freeman and Company, 1998. We will discuss the use of the CD-ROM later in the course. 
  * _MATH 111 Problem-Solving with Computational Tools Worksheets, Fall 1998 Version_ , Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hood College. 

###  Optional Resource Text:

  * _How To Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (Second Edition)_ , G. Polya, Princeton Univ. Press, 1985. 

###  Reserve Texts, Videos, and World Wide Web:

  * The Library has a reserve list for MATH 111 and a cross-listing for each MATH 111 instructor. There are two texts on reserve about using statistics in real situations. There is one text which provides an excellent introduction to computer hardware and software terms and applications. 
  * The Library also has the complete set of videos that accompany the text. You can make arrangements at the INFORMATION desk in the library to view the tapes. 
  * The World Wide Web page for this course (<http://yakko.hood.edu/~sjsmith/math111/>) has a link to this syllabus, and will (with any luck) be updated with links to lecture notes as the semester progresses. 

###  Smoking:

I am very allergic to tobacco smoke (it gives me headaches and nausea). If I
see you on campus, and you are smoking, I will avoid you; don't take it
personally. Try not to smoke just before coming to class, and especially try
not to smoke just before coming to see me in my office.

###  Assignments:

  * You will be expected to keep up with the readings by reading material before the class at which it will be discussed. However, I don't expect that you will understand everything that you have read. You do not serve yourself by being exposed to these ideas for the first time in lecture. Keep notes in the margins or in a notebook to remind you to ask them during lectures later. 
  * You are expected to prepare for labs by reading the lab exercises before coming to the lab class meeting. If we end up needing lab partners, and you choose to complete a lab assignment without your partner, you must clearly label work that was done on your own and work that was done together. 

###  No Communes:

Do not under any circumstances submit any assignment through communes (Hood's
campus mail system). Slip it under my door, put it in the box on my door, or
place it in my departmental mailbox (in Rosenstock room 330) by hand.

###  Final grades by email:

Students who provide me with an email address will receive their final grade
by email at the end of the semester.

###  Problem Solving Exercises:

Two to four problem solving exercises will be used this semester. You are
expected to solve these problems using strategies identified in class, in the
Polya text, in the For All Practical Purposes text, or of your own invention.
These exercises will take the place of the individual project normally
assigned in Math 111 classes.

###  Attendance:

Attendance is mandatory. Excessive absences will be reported to the
Registrar's office in accordance with College academic policies. If you are
not able to come to class, you need to contact the Dean of Students or myself.
Remember that absence from class does not excuse you from assigned work.

###  Honor Code:

  * All work **must** have the Honor Pledge ("I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.") written and signed on it. 
  * " ** _Authorized Aid_** " is defined differently for homework, problem solving assignments, exams, worksheets and lab assignments. 
    * **Problem solving assignments and exams are meant to be your own work. You may ask only me for assistance on these items.**
    * Homework and worksheets are designed to be done individually, but you may ask other students, the Teaching Assistant (TA), or me for assistance. In any case, the work you deliver must be your own individual product; students that work together to understand a problem may not turn in exact copies of the group assignment. 
    * Lab assignments are designed to be done by individuals. You may ask me or the Teaching Assistant for assistance on the lab. You may **_not_** ask other students for assistance. 
    * You may ask Lab Workers for assistance with electromechanical problems at any time.  

###  Teaching Assistants versus Lab Workers:

  * Teaching Assistants for Math 111 might be available. Their schedules will be posted shortly after the semester begins. You can find them during their scheduled hours at the Teaching Assistant's table in the third floor hallway in Rosenstock. 
  * The Mathematics and Computer Science Department Assistant, Atsuko Crum, will be on campus (Rosenstock room 310) during the regular work day and may assist you in the same capacity that a TA would. 
  * Lab Workers are student workers assigned to the labs. They are not expected to have completed MATH 111. They are there to keep the lab in operation, and are not expected to assist you on your assignments. 

###  Grading Policy:

  * Assignments are due on the dates specified in each assignment. You will be penalized 5 points for each class meeting an assignment is delayed, including the class at which the assignment is due. (If I excuse the lateness on some assignment you turn in, but mistakenly assess a late penalty, it's nothing personal: I just forgot. Remind me of your excuse and I'll correct the penalty.) No assignments will be accepted after Wednesday, 9 December 1998, at 3:30 pm. 
  * Written documentation is necessary for any excused absences or lateness. Students with disabilities are responsible for notifying the professor. All assignments are in English, and academic standards are applied equally to all students without regard to written, oral, or semantic capabilities in English. 
  * I will award partial credit for work done even if the result is incorrect; you must show all your intermediate work and clearly label your answer. I will deduct points for answers that do not make any sense at all; you should always check your work, even work done using the computer. 

###  Distribution of Weights in Grading:

Homework and Lab Assignments  |  30%  
---|---  
Worksheets (MS-DOS/Microsoft Excel)  |  10%  
Class Participation  |  5%  
Problem-Solving Exercises  |  15%  
Correct Solution  |  |  10% of exercise grade  
Exercise Report  |  |  90% of exercise grade  
Midterm Exam  |  20%  
Final Exam  |  20%  
  
###  Standard Disclaimer:

I reserve the right to change this syllabus.

###  Expectations:

  * Classes start on time and you should arrive on time. 
  * Ask questions in class and office hours. Please feel free to speak up if you did not understand something that was said. (If you don't understand something, I can only help you if I know that you don't understand it!) 
  * If you have a problem meeting some of the requirements for the class (for example, you are flying out of the country two days before the final exam period), please let me know as soon as you become aware of the problem. The sooner I know, the more likely it is that I will be able to arrange a solution.

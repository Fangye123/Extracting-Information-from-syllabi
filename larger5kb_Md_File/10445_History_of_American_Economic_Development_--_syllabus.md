**Recommended reading** (we'll use large parts of these books)

Course materials will be available online at

contains key questions for each topic, outlines for topics 2 and 12, and
practice exams.

**Objectives**  
This course uses economic concepts to explain the historical development of
the American economy. It correspondingly uses episodes in the historical
development of the American economy to illustrate economic concepts. The
lectures will give special emphasis to three themes: (1) the role of property
rights, especially in land and labor; (2) the evolution of monetary
institutions; and (3) the growth of government's role in the economy. We will
spend a disproportionate amount of time on the Civil War.  The texts provide
essential information. You will find it helpful to read the associated
chapters (listed below) in advance of the lectures, but note that the texts do
not cover everything that will be discussed in the lectures. Faithful class
attendance and note-taking are therefore important.

**Course requirements**

  * two midterm exams (dates to be announced)
  * one paper, around 8 pages long (topic guidelines to be announced)
  * one cumulative final exam, as scheduled by the University. (If you cannot make this date, drop the course now.)

Each midterm exam counts for 20% of your grade. The paper counts 30%. The
final exam counts the remaining 30%; more if you miss a midterm as explained
below.

Fine print: The following policies are stated as a matter of record: (1)
Midterm exams will each be given only on the dates announced; no make-ups. If
you miss a midterm exam for any reason, 20 percentage points will be added to
the weight of your final. (Note well: Final exam percentage scores tend to be
lower than midterm scores, which means that missing a midterm exam when you
don't have to is not a wise strategy.) (2) Failure to take the final exam at
the scheduled time will result in an exam score of zero, absent a certified
medical or family emergency. (3) Performance on these exams and the paper will
be the only basis for grading (no additional "extra credit" projects will be
offered or accepted). Grades are not negotiable. (4) Exam-taking and term-
paper-writing are governed by the UMSL's Student Code of Conduct. Academic
dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism) will result is an F for the course. (5) No
student may leave a midterm exam before 25 minutes have elapsed, or the final
exam before 45 minutes have elapsed; no student may enter a midterm or final
exam after anyone has left.

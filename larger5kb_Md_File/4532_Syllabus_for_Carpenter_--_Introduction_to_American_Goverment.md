Course Description: An introduction to national institutions and political
processes of American Government. Topics to be covered include American
constitutionalism, American political culture, civil rights and civil
liberties, bureaucracy, political parties, interest groups, the media, and the
policy process.

This course surveys the general institutions and cultural underpinnings of
American government. These structures of American government shape our policy
and our political experience. Throughout the semester we will attempt to
answer several core questions concerning American government. What are the
critical institutions of American government and how do they shape our
political life? What is the nature of American political culture and how does
it affect our politics? How did we get the rights, institutions and culture we
have today - restraint of governmental power, the two party system,
congressional seniority, affirmative action, interest groups, the welfare
state, the regulatory state? How can we account for political change? And how
can attention to the history and causal processes of American government help
us to understand the dilemmas now facing the American political system?

_Requirements:_ **_Students should read all scheduled materials and be
prepared to discuss them in class or in the section session._ For all writing
requirements, all students should be familiar with _The Elements of Style_ ,
by William Strunk, Jr., and E.B. White. This small book will function as the
standard for proper grammar and style for writing assignments in this course.
Flawless grammar and correct spelling are **minimum **requirements for
acceptable papers.**

  1. **Participation and Discussion Papers: Students are expected to maintain pace with class readings (one or two book chapters or articles per lecture, or about 80-100 pages per week) and to participate actively in class and GSI discussion. Five times during the semester students will submit a paper before a discussion section (2-3 pages). In these papers you may either (1) assess the class readings critically, or (2) ask how contemporary American politics has been influenced by the developments studied. Participation and the papers will account for 70 percent of your grade.**



**

IMPORTANT: Punctuality in the completion and submission of discussion papers
is essential. One-third of a grade is subtracted for every day late. That is,
if a paper is one day late, the highest grade it can receive is an A-. If two
days late, a B+, and so on.

** **

(2) Midterm Examination: Covering the first two modules in the course, this
examination will count for 10 percent of your grade

** **

(3) Final Examination or Final Paper: Covering the entire class, this
examination will account for 20 percent of your grade.

thinking on this problem.**

****

>     * **How do members of Congress vote? Is it all ideology, as Princeton's
Howard Rosenthal and Houston's**[ **Keith Poole**](http://voteview.uh.edu/)
**think? they've developed a set of methods called**[
**NOMINATE**](http://voteview.uh.edu/nominate/nominate.htm) **that tries to
numerically estimate legislators' ideology using their recorded roll-call
votes.**

U-M's**[ **Rick Hall**](http://polisci.lsa.umich.edu/faculty/rhall.html)
**might help us here.**

**

>     * Do committees alter policy, and how?

>     * Do congressional parties control all the relevant outcomes?

>     * How important is it to be in the congressional majority if you want to
be heard, or if you want to change policy or law?

**

> **

>     * Who controls Congress, or does anyone for that matter?

**World Wide Web Sites:**

The home page http://www.jbpub.com/starlinks, designed for users of the
textbook by the publisher is available. If you do not have a personal
computer, you should be able to access it at the Computer Center. You are
advised to use it regularly.

You will find the syllabus, assignments and other relevant information for
this course in http://www.gpc.peachnet.edu/~sfesseha.

**Paper**

The purpose of writing the paper is to enable you to research scientific
papers and to access useful astronomical information from the Internet. It
will also help the class to share new information that has not been printed on
our textbook yet.

You will write a two-page paper (typed strictly using a Microsoft Word
wordprocessor) on a topic you will choose from the following list. The paper
must be based on new information published within the last five years. To
demonstrate that you know the material you wrote in the paper, you will defend
your paper in class by giving an oral presentation on the due date. You may
use notes and read quotations but should not read an entire paragraph during
your presentation.

You are encouraged to present collaboratively in a group of two only if you
notify the instructor of collaborative work two weeks ahead of the
presentation day. Each member of a group must present part of the paper.  If
you choose to write on another subject, check with me first. Do not forget to
cite at least two recently published papers as bibliography. The grade for the
paper is based on the originality of the material, relevance to the course,
your knowledge of the material and your presentation. The following are topics
you may choose:

 1\. Specific Telescopes
8\. The Big Bang  
 2\. The Rings of Planets
9\. Famous Astronomers  
 3\. Space Programs
10\. Earthquakes  
 4\. Meteorites
11.The planets  
 5\. Satellites
12.Comets  
 6\. The Moons of Planets                                                 13\.
New Discoveries  
 7\. The Wonders of Astronomy

The paper is due on Tuesday, April 24, 2001.  If time does not allow, the
presentations may extend to April 26. On the presentation day, you should
submit a neatly organized paper and a three and a half-inch computer disk
containing the file of your paper only. Delete all other files from the disk
you intend to submit. Scan your disks and eliminate all viruses from your disk
before you submit. Remember that you will be graded on your organization and
neatness too. The name of the file of your paper should bear some resemblance
to the title of your paper.  10% will be deducted from the paper grade if a
student does not attend all presentations and leaves during presentations.

**Tests**

There will be four major tests during the semester, with no make up tests.
The lowest of the four test grades, or only one missed test grade, will be
dropped in computing your test average. You are encouraged to consult with
your instructor on your test scores to track your development in the semester.

**Final Examination**

A comprehensive final examination will be given on Tuesday, December 11, 2001,
1:00 -  3:00 p.m.

**Absences**

You are responsible for initialing the roll as it is passed around in the
first few minutes of each class meeting.  You are expected to be on time for
each class meeting. If you are late, it is your responsibility to get the roll
and initial it for that day, otherwise you will be counted as absent. If the
roll is collected by the instructor before a student signs, the student will
be marked late for late arrival. Two late markings will count as one absence.
You may not initial the roll later in the day or at some later date for a day
that you failed to initial the roll.  The instructor may take a roll at the
end of the class. If you have to leave early, inform the instructor at the
beginning of class. Otherwise, leaving early will also be counted as one
absence.  A student's responsibility for material covered is unaffected by
absence.  If you are absent, you should see another student or the class
instructor for an assignment for the next class meeting. If you miss more than
20% of the class meetings in each half semester, you will be considered
inactive and are subject to being withdrawn from the course.  For this class,
20% of each half semester is three absences. A student who violates the
attendance policy will be withdrawn and an appropriate grade recorded for him
or her depending on whether the last absence was before or after the mid-
semester.

**Withdrawals**

The last day to withdraw (passing) is Wednesday, October 17, 2001.  This is
important if you want to withdraw from the course with a "W" instead of an "F"
or a "WF".   Note:  You cannot withdraw from ASTR 1411 without also
withdrawing from ASTR 1411L (Lab).

**Incomplete**

An incomplete grade will be given to a student in good standing only when the
student is prevented from taking the final exam by circumstances beyond
his/her control; e.g., hospitalization, death in the family, or other similar
cause.  In such a case the student must notify the instructor before the final
examination by completing a form, which is a formal request for an incomplete.
Both the instructor and the department head must then approve the request.

**The Regent's Test**

The University of Georgia requires that all students enrolled in undergraduate
degree programs in University System institutions (including Georgia Perimeter
College) successfully complete all parts of a competency examination in
reading and English composition. This competency examination is commonly
called "the Regents' Test", and it is free of charge. A student has two
attempts to pass this test before accumulating 45 hours of collegiate credit.
Please sign up for the Regents' Test when you enroll in English 1102. Do this
in time to have two attempts before accumulating 45 credit hours!

**Student Behavior**

The instructor reserves the right to exclude a student or group of students
from class if found disruptive. Late entry, early exit, excessive talking and
outbursts are considered disruptive.

**Academic Honesty Policy - Cheating and Plagiarism**

Cheating is contrary to the policy of Georgia Perimeter College.  Cheating
includes any attempt to defraud, deceive, or mislead the instructor in
arriving at an honest grade assessment.  Plagiarism is a form of cheating that
involves presenting as one's own ideas the ideas or work of another.

All portions of any test, project or final exam submitted by you for a grade
must be your own work unless you are instructed to work collaboratively.
Specific requirements will be described for collaborative projects, but all
work presented must be the work of members of the group.  Research materials
used must be properly cited.

Violation of the Academic Honesty policy will result in a grade of "zero" for
that test, project or exam. A second offense will result in an assignment of a
grade of "F" for the course and a formal charge of Academic Dishonesty will be
lodged with the Dean of Student Affairs.

Policies have been established by Georgia Perimeter College to ensure due
process in charges of cheating or plagiarism.  A copy of these procedures can
be found in the Student Handbook.

**Americans with Disabilities Act**

If you are a student who is disabled as defined under the Americans with
Disabilities Act and require assistance or support services, please seek
assistance through the Center for Disability Services.  A CDS Counselor will
coordinate those services.

**Equal Opportunity**

No person shall, on the grounds of race, color, sex, religion, creed, national
origin, age or disability, be excluded from employment or participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity conducted by Georgia Perimeter College.

**Affirmative Action**

Georgia Perimeter College adheres to affirmative action policies designed to
promote diversity and equal opportunity for all faculty and students.

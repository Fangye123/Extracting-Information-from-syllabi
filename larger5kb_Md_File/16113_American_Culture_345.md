## American Culture 345

# AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY

Instructor: Mary McGuire  
Office: 118 Tyler (East Quad-Residential College)  
Office Hours: Tues. 11-1 and 2-4 (additional hours by appointment)  
  
**FOCUS:**  

This is a wide-ranging course which examines certain contemporary social
concerns in an effort to define and map the politics of late twentieth century
America. In this course we will be exposed to a variety of academic and
popular materials in order t o understand how social issues become political
agendas and how political agendas dictate social concerns. In this course our
definition of "the political" is a broad one, ranging from the politics of
private life and the family to the politics of citize nship and nation.  
  
**GOALS:**  

In this course we have three interconnected goals. First, this class is
intended as a "hands-on" introduction to the possibilities of
interdisciplinary social science research. Second, this course has been
planned to introduce students to the researc h of faculty members in the
social sciences at the University of Michigan who are associated with the
Program in American Culture. Third, we will use this class to introduce
students to the electronic resources available on the Internet and other on-
line resources such as Lexis/Nexis.  
  
**EXPECTATIONS:**  
  

Students are expected to attend class; to do the readings and come prepared to
discuss them; and to complete the required assignments on time. Most
importantly, students are expected to contribute to an engaged discussion at
every class session. This means not only being an active discussant, it also
means being a thoughtful listener. It is essential that we create a class in
which the opinions and perspectives of all can be appreciated--even in
disagreement! This is a seminar, which means that a s izable share of the
success of the class depends on your willingness to become involved at all
levels.  
  
**ASSIGNMENTS:**  
  
Readings: Two to three articles per week (approximately 80 pp. on average).  
Weekly Assignments: Five 2-3 page typed, double-spaced response papers (every
other week). Five articles or other information from the Internet or other
online resources (opposite weeks).  
Group Project: Class presentation of two additional articles and group leads
the Wednesday discussion section.  
Final Project: A 7-10 page paper, using only the materials from the course, in
which you will "map" the social issues and political agendas of late twentieth
century America. This is due at the end of the term.  
  
**GRADES:**  

  * Discussion: 15% 
  * 5 Online Contributions: 10% 
  * 5 Short Position Papers: 25% 
  * Group Project: 20% 
  * Final Paper: 30%o 
  
  
**HOW TO LOWER YOUR GRADE WITHOUT EVEN TRYING:**  
  

Disruptive and disrespectful behavior toward the class as a whole or any
member in it will not be tolerated. Late assignments will not be accepted
without prior arrangement and a very good reason (medical or personal
emergency). Repeated absences (mo re than two for the semester) are
unacceptable, except in the case of documented medical or personal emergency.
Tardiness is likewise unappreciated and a pattern of arriving late (or leaving
early) is not acceptable.

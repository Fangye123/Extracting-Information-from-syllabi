**I. COURSE DESCRIPTION**

****

Scientific inquiry is often considered the method _par excellence_ of
acquiring knowledge about the world. What is it about science and its method
that gives it this reputation? This course examines several different
perspectives on science, looking at what they claim the aims of science are
and what they say about its operation. We will begin by considering various
facets of the scientific enterprise from the perspective on science dominant
during the first half of the 20th century: logical empiricism. This school of
thought sought to develop formal accounts of such activities as the
confirmation of hypotheses and the explanation of phenomena in a way that
grounded science on the epistemically secure basis of the observable. This
perspective was challenged in the second half of the 20th century by an
approach that shifted the focus from analysis of the formal structure of
scientific activities to scrutiny of the history of science. This historicist
approach rejected the earlier assumption of a common, pure (i.e.,  "theory-
neutral") observation basis, emphasizing instead the radical discontinuities
in the worldviews offered by successive scientific theories. At its most
extreme, this approach has characterized these breaks as involving not just
changes in worldview, but as transitions to "different worlds". A third
perspective on science rejects both logical empiricism and historicism, opting
instead for a "realist" view committed to taking science as in the business of
(and succeeding to some extent at) developing a literally true story about the
world. After a brief introduction to scientific method, we will consider these
three perspectives on science in turn, examining their central theses and
arguments, with the aim of developing a better understanding of the nature of
science in general.

About the Requirements:

_

_Class Participation_ \--One thing this requirement covers is your _class
attendance_ (if you don't attend class you can't participate in it). However,
to get an "A" for class participation you must do more than just show up; you
have to contribute to class discussion. You are expected to show up having
read the assignment for the day and ready to talk about it.

_The First Paper_ \--There will be a **5-8 page paper** due at the end of May.
Topics will be distributed 1 week before the paper is due. Papers are due at
the **beginning** of class on the due date. Late papers are subject to a
substantial grade reduction (you really don't want to find out how much).

_The Midterm Exam_ \--There will be an in-class midterm exam on **Monday, June
4th**. The exam will consisit of short answer questions and an essay based on
the readings and lectures.

_The Second Paper_ \--There will be a second **5-8 page paper** due on the
last day of class. Again, topics will be handed out 1 week before the paper is
due, and all papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late
submission is still not a good idea.

_The Final Exam_ \--There will be a final exam given during the scheduled exam
time. The exam will cover the whole course, but will heavily emphasize the
material since the midterm. As with the midterm, the final will consist of
short answer questions and essay questions based on the readings and lectures.

IV. CLASS FORMAT

**

The class will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and I want to encourage
discussion. I expect you all to show up having read the assignment for that
meeting and ready to use it as a point of departure. It is the nature of the
issues we will be considering that people's views will differ. You are
encouraged to question your classmates (and me) when anyone says something you
disagree with, but everyone should always keep in mind that disagreement is
not a personal attack. Philosophical discussion thrives under this kind of
interaction and often stems from disagreement. At the same time, philosophical
discussion _aims at_ reaching some sort of agreement. We probably won't reach
agreement every time, but we should aspire toward it.

V. TOPICS AND READINGS**

****

Most of the readings for the course are from the books by Hempel and Kuhn.
These readings are listed below by author and chapter number. The other
readings (those labeled "photocopy") are from the coursepack and are listed by
author and title. Again, the coursepack is available at New University Copies
located at 11 Waverly Place.

**A note about the readings:** Philosophical writing is often subtle and
difficult. Do not be fooled by the shortness of an assignment into thinking
that it will take little time. Most of these readings should be read _at least
twice_. I recommend a first time straight through and then a second time
slowly while taking notes. In addition, because of the compressed nature of
the term, you will be required to read something new every night. We will be
moving fast, so it is crucial that you keep up with the reading.

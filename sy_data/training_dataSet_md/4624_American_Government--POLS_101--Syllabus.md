### Course Description

This course has two objectives. The first is to help you learn to think about
government and politics. The second is to familiarize you with a body of
information about our politics, history, and institutions of government. Under
the first objective, we will try to develop your _critical thinking ability_.
"Critical" does not mean "negative." It means your ability to free yourself,
temporarily, from your preconceptions and take a new, fresh look at something
--a look that is uniquely yours.

The course has a theme, which is to examine American politics by asking
whether or not the nation is governed by an elite, by democratic pluralism, or
under some other system. We will be asking both _empirical_ and _normative_
questions about this nation's politics. Empirical statements attempt to
portray the world as it is. Normative statements are phrased in terms of what
ought to be. Simply put, empirical statements are about facts, and normative
statements are about values. The distinction between the two kinds of
statements is often hard to make in practice, but it is a useful analytical
tool, so we will begin by accepting that there is a difference, and learn to
question it later. For example, an empirical statement about democracy might
be,  "American is (or is not) a democracy." A normative statement might be,
"America should (or should not) be a democracy." We will be examining
questions like this, looking at them from a variety of perspectives, and along
the way absorbing a considerable amount of information about the American
system of government that should help you answer some of these questions for
yourself.

I hope we will have an open and lively class discussion every session, and one
which is also respectful of differences of opinion and always civil and
polite. Please be assured that you cannot possibly hurt your grade by
disagreeing with what you think I believe, nor can you help it by agreeing!
And I should warn you that I often play 'Devil's Advocate." That means I will
defend positions with which I disagree. I am most likely to do this if I think
the classroom discussion is too one-sided. Above all, suspend your quick
judgements about things, listen to your classmates, read your books, and think
about things as if you were encountering them for the first time.

### Course Requirements

  * _Midterm examination_ (25%): Given as set in the course schedule below, this will combine objective and essay format in about a 50/50 format. 
  * _Final examination_ (25%): Same format as the midterm, given on the day and time set by the University. 
  * _Weekly reaction papers_ (10%): Every Monday you will turn in a one-page summary of the readings, concluding with two or three questions or issues that struck you as particularly significant. 
  * _Media Journal_ (15%) You will keep a journal with clippings and your comments, tracing issues you consider important. More about this later, but the idea is for you to get informed, and also to learn to consider the influence of the media on the way issues are framed, the values they promote, the things they include and exclude, and other aspect of a critical perspective on the media. 
  * _Political Film paper_ (15%): You will compare and critically evaluate a pair of political films from a list I will provide. Again, more about this later. 
  * _Participation_ (10%): Attendance is mandatory. I will take roll at the start of every class session. Anybody missing more than six classes will fail the course. You are also being evaluated on the quality of your participation, meaning the degree to which you help us have a productive classroom community. Civility, originality,intelligence, preparation...these are the things to bring to the discussion.

|  | **Course Description:**

This course is an introduction to the use of qualitative methods in political
science. Studying qualitative methods entails several distinct, but related,
tasks. First, the course will cover issues of research design using
qualitative methods, drawing on recent methodological and philosophy of
science debates. Second, the course will focus on the strategies and
techniques of qualitative analysis. These include data gathering techniques
such as observation (participant and non-participant), interviewing, and
archival research. They also include strategies for recording, organizing, and
writing up qualitative field data. Finally, they include political and ethical
issues of field research. Third, we will also discuss grant-writing, and all
students will write a research grant proposal.

Qualitative methods are not only appropriate to the study of politics, but are
in fact used quite widely in the field of political science. In some
subfields, such as comparative politics and public administration, case
studies and other kinds of qualitative research comprise a substantial part of
both past and current research in the field. Many of our graduate students
have used qualitative methods for their PhD dissertations and MA theses.
Political scientists have been slow, in comparison to other disciplines, to
reflect and write about their use of such methods. Yet the methods have quite
clear standards for such research choices as case selection, research design,
and data-gathering and -analyzing procedures. In the last decade, political
scientists have begun to be more self-conscious about such standards and
procedures, and this course is an introduction to that literature.

**Course Requirements and Evaluation:**

The course is designed with the view that the best way to learn research
methods is to combine theoretical readings and discussion with hands-on
practice. To that end, students will select two of three field exercises
associated with the different techniques for gathering qualitative data, and
will record and write up their observations. Each of these exercises is worth
20% of the final grade (40% together). As a final course project, students
will design a research proposal with a substantial qualitative research
component. This will be worth 40% of the final grade. The field exercises and
the research proposal will serve as the exams in the course. Class meetings
will follow a seminar format. Class participation is worth 20% of the final
grade. Students are expected to attend all seminar meetings and to complete
all course assignments on time. Any exceptions should be cleared with the
instructor, preferably in advance.  
  
Missing more than one class and/or failure to complete any assignment are
grounds for a failing grade in the seminar.

Earning full credit for participation depends upon close and thoughtful
reading of the assigned course materials. Seven books have been ordered for
the course; they are available for purchase in the bookstore, and some are
available on reserve in the library. In addition, there are a number of
articles and book chapters (marked with an asterisk -*- in the syllabus) which
are available on reserve and in the political science mailroom. Materials in
the mailroom should not leave the immediate area except for photocopying.
Please be considerate of your fellow students.

You are expected to write
three essays during the semester based on the readings and general themes
discussed in class.  The broad titles
for the three essays are provided below. 
The quotes and the set of questions that follow are only advisory and
suggestive on the substance to be covered and the possible directions your
essay could follow. You may cover more or less, or adopt other directions.
However, most of the themes suggested in the questions  must be addressed.
 
The essays should be about
15-20 pages double-spaced depending on the font you use.  Essay I is due Tuesday March 5th; Essay II
by Tuesday April 16th; and Essay III on or before Thursday May 9th.
 
 
 
                                           I.  International Society and the Use of Force

the nature of the international system." 
 
Reflect on this statement
with reference to the following: (a) The underlying sources of conflict (e.g.
Waltz and others). (b) Classical and contemporary perspectives on war and peace
(e.g., Hobbesian, Kantian and Grotian perspectives, the lessons of the "Athenian-Melian
dialogue, E.H. Carr's critique of the "harmony of interests," etc.
(c) Conventional and Nuclear Military balances. (d) Insurgency and terrorism as
a means of warfare. (E) Regional economic integration and globalization as
responses to violent conflict.
 
 
                                      II.  Nations, Nationalism and the Future of the
State
 
"Controlling and
containing nationalism and secessionist movements in the world will prove to be
a far greater challenge to US foreign and security policy-makers as compared to
their past ability to avoid or manage conflict during the Cold War."
 
Explore the above observation
with reference to the following: (a) Interpretations of ethnicity, nation,
nationalism, state, nation-state, and sovereignty. (b) The demands of ethnic
groups who insist on the right to national self-determination, as against that
of governments who insist on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
states. (c) Nationalism, Civil War and Humanitarian Intervention
 
 
                                     III.  Post Cold War and Weapons of Mass
Destruction
 
"The end of the Cold War
has made little difference to the spread of weapons of mass destruction."
 
Address the above
observations with reference to the following: (a) Explanations for the Cold
War. (b) The technological, legal and strategic aspects of the nuclear weapons
proliferation problem. (c) Parallels and differences in the problems of
biological and chemical weapons proliferation compared with that of nuclear

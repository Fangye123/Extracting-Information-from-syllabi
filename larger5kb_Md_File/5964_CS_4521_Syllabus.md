**Bulletin Description:  
** Common abstract data types such as lists, maps, sets, trees, tries, heaps,
priority queues, graphs definitions. Time and space analysis of related
algorithms such as sorting, hashing, graph search, shortest paths, strongly-
connected components, order statistics, string compression, search.

**Prerequisites:  
** Quarter prerequisite: CS 1623, 3710 or #, Semester prerequisite: CS 2511,
Math 3355 or #, or the equivalent if you are a transfer student. **Important
note:** The computer science program at UMD is accredited by CAC (the
Computing Accreditation Commission). One of the CAC requirements is that all
students _must_ satisfy the prerequisites in order to be admitted to a course,
so if you have not passed the prerequisite courses, you will be asked to drop
this course (if you have any questions about this, please see the instructor
after the lecture or during office hours).

**Course Objectives and Content:  
** Advanced computer programming requires an understanding of both the objects
on which programs work, that is, data structures, and the sequences of steps
driving the programs themselves, that is, algorithms. In order for data
structures and algorithms to be generally useful, they often must overcome
memory and speed limitations of the underlying machine. Thus it is important
for the programmer to be able to analyze algorithms for their efficiency in
execution and use of space for data. This course will approach the study of
data structures and algorithms with an eye toward both analyzing efficiency
and developing working models using sound data abstraction and procedural
abstraction practices.

The following is a rough outline of the material that I hope to cover in the
course. We will start with a discussion of algorithms and their analysis and
design. This will be followed by a review of growth of functions and solving
recurrences. Then we will discuss most of the following topics: binary search
trees, red-black trees, B-trees, hash tables, binary heaps and priority
queues, binomial heaps, Fibonacci heaps, amortized analysis, graph algorithms,
minimal spanning trees, shortest path algorithms, and string matching.
Additional material may also be covered, such as dynamic programming, greedy
algorithms, amortized analysis, encryption, NP-completeness, and approximate
algorithms.

**Equal Opportunity:  
** The University of Minnesota is committed to the policy that all persons
shall have equal access to its programs, facilities, and employment without
regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital
status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, or sexual
orientation. As instructor, I am committed to upholding University of
Minnesota's equal opportunity policy. I encourage you to talk to me in private
about any concerns you have related to equal opportunity in the classroom. To
inquire further about the University's policy on equal opportunity, contact
the Office of Equal Opportunity, 255 DAdB, [

**Students with Disabilities:  
** If you have any disability (either permanent or temporary) that might
affect your ability to perform in this class, please inform me at the start of
the quarter. I may adapt methods, materials, or testing so that you can
participate equitably. To learn about the services that UMD provides to
students with disabilities, contact the Access Center/Disability Services 138

to Algorithms, Second Edition,_ ](http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms)
September, 2001, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, ISBN: 0-262-03293-7 or McGraw-Hill,

**Course Requirements:  
** You are responsible for reading assigned text material and for material
covered in class, including:

  1. doing the reading assignments from the text 
  2. the material covered in the lectures 
  3. obtaining assignments and handouts 
  4. turning in programming assignments and homework  

If you are unable to attend a class meeting, it is your responsibility to
obtain class notes, assignments, and extra copies of handouts from your study
partner. **Note:** all assignments are due at the _beginning_ of class on the
due date. Assignments will be docked 25% per day if turned in late.

**Assignments:  
**

The assignments will consist of both programming and non-programming problems.
Programming assignments will be based on algorithms written in a generic
pseudo-code presented in lecture and in the text. The solutions can be written
in your choice of programming language, but keep in mind that the instructor
and teaching assistant will only provide help for programs written in
languages with which they are familiar. The C++ and Java languages are
appropriate for implementing data structures (and the instructor is more
familiar with C++ than Java). Also, there may be one or two assignments near
the end of the course that are specific to C++. The programming assignments
should adhere to the [ Computer Science Lab Report Format ](labformat.html)

**Examinations and Grading:  
**

There will be a midterm exam, worth 100 points and a final exam worth 200
points. These exams are closed book, but you are allowed to bring _one_ 4 x 6
inch note card to the midterm exam as a crib sheet, and _two_ such cards to
the final exam. The final exam will be comprehensive. Exams will _not_ be
given early, and makeups must be justified by dire circumstances described to
the instructor _before_ the time of the exam. It is Department of Computer
Science policy not to return final exams, however they are kept and you can
look at your exam in the instructor's office.

**Exam Schedule:** **Exam**|  **Points**|  **Date and Time  
---|---|---  
Midterm Exam |  100 points  |  Wednesday, October 31, 9-9:50 am in HH 302  
Final Exam |  200 points  |  Wednesday, December 19, 10-11:55 am in HH 302  
  
Scores and total points will be posted periodically on the "` Grades`" page of
the class web site:  
[
http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs4521/grades](http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs4521/grades)  
using the last four digits of your student id number. If you wish to have your
scores posted using a number other than your student id, you may email your
request to the instructor.

**Grading Procedures:** Final grades are based on total points distributed
approximately as follows:

  * Labs and homework assignments (approx. 300 points) 
  * Midterm Exam (100 points) 
  * Final Examination (200 points) 
Grades are assigned based on a percentage of the total points.

  * The A- cutoff is 90% 
  * The B- cutoff is 80% 
  * The C- cutoff is 70% 
  * The D cutoff is 60% 
  * Below 60% is an F 
These percentages may be lowered slightly but they will not be raised.

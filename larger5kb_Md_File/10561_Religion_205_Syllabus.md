|   |  The course is an in depth study of Genesis, the first book of the
bible. The focus will be primarily literary, stressing issues such as style,
compositional history, plot and characterization. In addition, we will examine
the context in which the work was authored, looking at historical realities of
the period as well as Ancient Near Eastern texts that shed light on the bible.
Finally, the students will be introduced to basic methods of scriptural
interpretation.

REQUIREMENTS: Midterm (20%), Final (30%), Term Paper (43%) and Class
Participation (7%).

EXAMS: These are intended to test your "Genesis literacy", your command of
basic names, dates, concepts, etc. The midterm will be 1 hour long, taken on
meeting 8 (Sept 29). The final will be self-scheduled and closed book. Though
designed to take no longer than two hours, you will have the full session to
complete it.

PAPER: This is a 10-12 page paper on a Genesis topic of your choice. All
students must consult with me on their topic selection. The library session on
meeting 7 (Sept 25) is designed to acquaint students with the research tools
necessary to work independently on a bible paper. The paper is due on the last
class meeting (Dec 8). I will read rough drafts that are submitted on meeting
21 (Nov 17) or earlier. More details, and a handout, will be provided early in
the semester regarding the term paper.

CLASS PARTICIPATION: Students must come to class, having completed all the
readings, prepared to participate and be called on. The grade will not be
based upon brilliant contributions. Rather, students will be expected to
attend class, do the work, and make a genuine attempt to struggle with the
issues in the text.

Late work will not receive full credit, and incompletes will only be given in
exceptional cases such as significant emergencies. There is also no "January
Option" available.

DISABILITIES: Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and
who need disability-related classroom or testing accommodations are encouraged
to see me as soon as possible. Barbara Boger, the Director of Programs of the
Learning and Teaching Center (x2092), and James Wice, the Director of
Disablity Services (x2434), are available in the Learning and Teaching Center
in Clapp Library to assist students in arranging these accommodations.

TEXTS: Robert Alter's Genesis commentary and translation is required and
available in the bookstore. In addition, all students must have a volume with
the full Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in English translation. Any edition is
acceptable. The Harper Collins Study Bible (NRSV) is suggested for this and
all Wellesley bible courses, (Old and New Testaments), and is also available
in the bookstore. Please bring Alter and the full bible to class each session.
All other readings will be on reserve [R] or handed out in class. Several
Genesis commentaries are checked out to study Carel 1 #05 and must be used in
the library. In addition, a copy of all the readings will be in a file box
marked with the course number at Carel 1 #05. These must be read or copied in
the library and cannot be taken out of the building.

PREPARATION: For a typical class session, you will have a Genesis reading,
with the possibility of supplementary primary texts (from other biblical
sections or Near Eastern literature) and secondary articles or commentary
assignments. I suggest you prepare as follows: Read the Genesis passage along
with Alter's commentary. Then read the other assignments, consulting the
Genesis text as needed. Finally, reread the Genesis unit, taking into account
the points of view and issues in the supplementary texts and articles. Certain
Genesis sections and other readings can be looked at quickly without review,
and these will be indicated with the notation "skim". On a regular basis, you
will receive a handout, with questions to direct and focus your readings and
the class discussion.

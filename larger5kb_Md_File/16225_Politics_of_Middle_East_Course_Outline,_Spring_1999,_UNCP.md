**Course Description:  ** The Middle East is a vast geographical region
stretching from Morocco in the East to Iran in the West.  It incorporates a
diverse array of cultures and political systems. Politically, most Middle East
states are developing nations grappling with the dilemmas of political
developing and modernization. This process has not only been complicated by
the presence of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, but huge oil reserves and a
large influx of capital.  The focus of this course is to familiarize the
student with the problems and processes of Middle East politics through a
comparative examination of the regions' political systems.  This is achieved
by employing the scope, methods, and concepts of comparative politics which
enable the student to acquire a better understanding of the political culture,
political elites and policy processes distinct to Middle East political
systems.

](http://www.uncp.edu/political/server.htm)  


5). Suggested Current Event Readings:  Because the Middle East is a dynamic
political environment, all students are to regularly read news papers or news
journals concerning the Middle East events.  In particulars links to the
following newspapers are good sources of current events materials.

  * [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/world/)
  * [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/m-international.html)

  * [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/nw1.htm)
  * [Jerusalem Post](http://www.jpost.com)

6). Grading Policy: In the event unusual or unforeseen circumstances prevent
you from completing the course, an "I" grade will be assigned. "The "I", or
incomplete grade, is only given when a student is unable to complete required
work because of unavoidable circumstances such as illness. It is not given to
enable a student to do additional work to improve a grade.  If an "I" is
assigned, the incomplete work must be finished by the next academic semester
(excluding summer term) or it is automatically converted to a grade of "F" by
the University Registrar.  In determination of quality hours and quality
points averages, an "I" is counted as an "F" until it is removed." ( see UNC-P
Schedule of Classes for additional information).  Students who qualify for an
"I" must meet with the instructor the second week of the next semester to
discuss plans to complete unfinished class work. In the event a student must
withdraw from the University, it is the responsibility of the student to
complete and turn in all appropriate forms. A student is not automatically
withdrawn from a class when he/she discontinues attending class unless the
appropriate proper paperwork has been turned into the Registrars Office (see
UNC-P Catalog for discussion on WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY).  If your name
still appears on the final role and you have not been attending class, you
will be assigned an "F" for the course.  Conversely, if you decided to drop
this course during the course of the semester, you must do so by September 10
to receive a "W" grade.  A course cannot be dropped after this date (see UNC-P
Schedule of Classes).  It is the responsibility of the student to obtain
proper signatures on the drop-add form and turn in the completed form to the
Registrar's Office.  Students appearing on final role, who have not been
attending class, will be assigned an "F" for the course.

7). Class Attendance Policy: Each student is expected to attend each class
period beginning with the first class.  If participation in University
sponsored activities or work related activities cause a student to miss an
excessive number of classes, then the student should not enroll in the class.
Daily attendance will be taken and those students who have missed three
unexcused class periods will have their final grade lowered by one letter
grade.  Additionally, students are expected to arrive for class at the
assigned time.  If the door has been shut by the instructor, you will not be
allowed to enter class.  Lastly, all students are expected to discuss and
critique the material read, therefore students will be call upon by the
instructor to give their opinions or comment on the class discussions.
Because verbal communication and critical thinking are vital skills of a
successful college graduate, direct and active class participation is strongly
encouraged and fostered in this class.

8). Grading Scale: The following is the breakdown of points for each
assignment.  The final letter grade assigned for the class will reflect the
appropriate "+" or "-" when applicable.  The range of grades from "A" to "F"
are based on the percentage of total points received and conform to a 10
percentage point scale.  For example, the "A" grade represents a mastery of
90% or more indicated by combined test and assignments grades which
corresponds to a total of 450 or more points in the class.

_The Classical Worlds: Ancient Greece and Rome  
  
_**Textbooks** :  
        ***ALL ARE REQUIRED READING, BUT NOT ALL ARE REQUIRED FOR PURCHASE ***  
  
    Arthur W.H. Adkins and Peter White, eds. _Readings in Western Civilization, 1: The Greek Polis_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986).  
  
    Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr. __ and Peter White, eds.  _Readings in Western Civilization, 2: Rome, Late Republic and Principate_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986).  
  
    G. E. R. Lloyd, editor, _Hippocratic Writings_ , (New York: Penguin, 1983).  
  
    Plutarch, _Makers of Rome_ , (New York: Penguin, 1965).

    Chester G. Starr, _A History of the Ancient World_ 4th edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986).   PLEASE NOTE: This is an expensive book, and although some copies have been ordered in the bookstore, it is NOT REQUIRED for purchase.  You may feel free to share the cost with friends in the class, or to borrow a copy from another library.  I have placed a copy of the volume on reserve in Andruss Library.  You may also substitute for this book any reliable general history of the ancient world.  This is the best one, in my opinion, but you may also try, for example, John Boardman's _The Oxford History of the Classical World_ (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986).   I have placed this one also on reserve in Andruss Library.  In addition to the one-volume version on reserve, you may find it published in paperback in two parts: _The Oxford History of Greece and the Hellenistic World_ , and _The Oxford History of the Roman World_.  
  
**Course requirements** :  
  
    1.  Regular class preparation/participation.  This is the crucial element in the composition of your final grade.  The daily readings required in this course are extensive, so the emphasis of the course is here, rather than on lots of written assignments.  Active class participation, by analyzing primary and secondary sources, is required.  It counts for 30% of your final grade.  
  
    2.  Papers. _Two, 3-5 page analytical essays_ on the book-length primary sources examined in class: the _Hippocratic Writings_ _ _,__ and Plutarch's _Makers of Rome_. Each of these essays must argue a **thesis** that can be demonstrated with the use of **quotations** from the text (used in the form of direct address), and include an **introduction** that sets the text in **context** , plus a **conclusion** that explains the **historical significance** of what you have argued in the paper.   Follow the instructions available in the **[Term Paper Guide](http://facstaff.bloomu.edu/hudon/guide_for_term_papers.htm)** on this website.   These papers count for 30% of your final grade.  
  
    3\. Research paper/project.  
          Students enrolled in the 42.316 version of this course (for undergraduate credit) must complete a research paper.  The research paper can be in one of two forms: either a **primary-focused** research paper, or an **historiographic essay**.   These research papers, whether primary or historiographic, must be 8 to 10 typewritten pages in length.  Consult with the instructor for guidance on picking a topic for the project.  In individual cases, as determined by the instructor, a student in 316 may complete a project like the one described below for those in the graduate section of the course.  If you want to exercise this option, consult the instructor.  
          Students enrolled in the 42.516 version of this course (for graduate credit) must also complete a research project/paper.   The research project can take either of the following two forms: (1) a **twenty-page** **research paper** on   a topic chosen in consultation with the instructor; **or** (2) a **three-week unit plan** on teaching the classical worlds to students in grades 6-12.   This requires daily lesson plans and an annotated bibliography.  
        The research paper/project for all students will count as 40% of the final grade.

**IFS JOINT PHD IN FRENCH STUDIES and POLITICS**

> The joint Ph.D. program in French Studies and Politics is designed for
students interested in combining a multidisciplinary approach to the study of
France with broad graduate training in political science. Students pursuing
the degree may wish to prepare for careers of research and teaching in a
political science department and/or in a French department, with a specialty
in French culture and civilization.

>

> Students who apply for the joint program with politics in their initial
application to the IFS, as well as those who decide to enter it after they
arrive at NYU, must be formally admitted by both the Institute and the
Department of Politics. Students should consult their advisors in both the IFS
and the Politics Department to fashion an individual program of study within
the guidelines described below.

  * **COURSE WORK** 

> A total of 72 points is required for the Ph.D. At least 36 points will be
from each unit. Cross-listed courses may be used toward point distribution
requirements for both units. In general, credits are not transferable to the
joint program from prior degrees earned elsewhere.

>

> All students are required to choose ONE specialty field within Political
Science. In most cases, this will be Comparative Politics, but depending on
the student's research interests, International Relations, Political Theory or
Political Economy may be selected instead.

>

> Students are required to take  
>  *** at least 3 courses in this specialty field  
>  * at least 1 course in a second field**  
>  including at least 1Comparative Politics course focusing on Europe (e.g.
G53.2521/2531).

>

> In addition, the following courses are required for the joint degree:  
>  *** The French Fifth Republic (G53.2523/G46.1730)  
>  * One methods course (e.g. 53.1120/2108/2129)  
>  * One Research in Progress course**

>

> Refer to the IFS M.A. Regulations for required course work at IFS.

  * **EXAMINATION REQUIREMENTS** 

>  
>  The PhD qualifying examination is normally taken by the end of the 8th
semester, and is administered by a four-member examination committee,
including at least two members from the Politics Department and two from IFS.
The examination consists of four parts:

>

> 1\. **A TAKE-HOME EXAMINATION IN FRENCH STUDIES** , combining IFS Fields I
(history) and ONE of the remaining French Studies fields (Society, Politics
and Economy, OR Culture).

>

> The student, in consultation with members of the examination committee, will
prepare a research bibliography defining the French Studies field. This
bibliography is meant to help develop the student's approach to and definition
of the area and must be submitted to the French Studies members of the
examination committee for approval at least three months prior to the exam
(normally by late January of the 4th year of matriculation). The French
Studies examination will be drawn from the material in the approved
bibliography.

>

> The examination question will be picked up on the day the student submits
the final Qualifying Paper and Syllabus (normally no later than April 30 of
the fourth year of matriculation.) This examination will be due four days
later, and will consist of an essay of no more than ten double-spaced pages,
to which is attached of bibliography of no more than two pages.

>

> **2\. AN ORIGINAL SYLLABUS** for a graduate introduction to the student's
specialty field in Political Science (Comparative Politics, International
Relations, Political Theory, or Political Economy). This syllabus should
attest to an understanding of the structure of the field as well as to the
knowledge of the primary and secondary literature.

>

> **3\. A RESEARCH PAPER** (qualifying paper) of publishable quality,
satisfying all formal requirements for an article in the student's specialty
field, and attesting to the student's ability to develop rigorous political
analysis, well-informed by French area studies expertise. Before writing the
paper, students should submit a brief proposal to the examination committee.
The paper will be evaluated by the examination committee at least two months
prior to formal submission (normally by late February of the 4th year of
matriculation). The committee has the options of accepting the paper,
suggesting revisions, or rejecting the paper.

>

> **4\. A TWO-HOUR ORAL EXAMINATION** covering the written work described
above, conducted by the four-member examination committee. This examination
will be scheduled during the week following final submission of all three
parts of the written examination.

>

> Successful completion of the examination qualifies the student to proceed to
the research and writing of the dissertation. A student failing the French
Studies part of the examination may take it a second time; students submitting
an unacceptable syllabus or qualifying paper may be invited to revise and
resubmit within six months. A student who fails the written exam twice or
whose revisions are not accepted will be discontinued from the program.

  * **DISSERTATION PROPOSAL** 

> Normally the semester before, but no later than three months following the
Ph.D. exam, a dissertation proposal must be submitted to three faculty members
(including at least one from IFS and one from Politics). This proposal will be
reviewed for approval in an oral interview with this faculty committee. This
interview is not an examination and no grade will be given. Students are
strongly urged to schedule the proposal interview PRIOR to deadlines for
submission to external funding agencies.

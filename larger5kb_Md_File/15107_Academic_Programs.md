**Required MAGES Courses**

**ECON 547** **The European Economy**  
The European Economy proceeds on a variety of levels, ranging from labor
markets to foreign direct investment, trade, institutional harmonization,
fiscal policy coordination and monetary union. This course concentrates on a
subset of these developments: The integration of the goods market (trade) and
of factor markets (foreign direct investment and labor mobility). The course
follows a dual strategy, beginning with an examination of theoretical issues
arising in each of the aforementioned areas, such as the determinants of trade
patterns, the income distribution consequences of opening trade, the motives
for capital and labor mobility, etc. These concepts are then applied
specifically to the case of Europe, including the relevant economic history,
the current institutional framework, the observed effects of liberalization on
trade and income patterns and the remaining obstacles.

**[Wolf](../Faculty/Wolf.htm)  

******GERM 510 Theorizing Culture**  
The course will introduce students to the study of culture, with a focus on
theories of gender and sexuality. We will draw on a range of German, French,
and Anglo-American theories of high, popular, and mass culture and apply them
to contemporary German cultural texts, performances, objects, and practices.
The course is organized around four major media, genres, and sites of cultural
production: from print culture (literature), and visual culture (film, tv), to
cyberspace, and live bodies/urban space. The course will be conducted as a
seminar, with a strong emphasis on our working together to explore the
parameters of this new field. Each student will be asked to choose a sub-area
of contemporary culture theory on which he/she will focus. Working
independently, in pairs or small work-groups, students will investigate how a
particular theoretical approach might be applied to a German cultural artifact
of the group's choice, presenting the results of their investigations to other
members of the seminar. Each student will also be asked to write a weekly
journal documenting his/her responses to the course material. At the end of
the seminar, students will have several options for a final project, including
a research paper or a take-home examination. Texts will be made available.

****GOVT 590 The European Union**  
**This course examines the European Union from a variety of disciplinary
perspectives - political science, history, and cultural studies. It is divided
into three parts. The first part addresses the history of postwar European
integration in its political, social, and cultural dimensions. The course then
moves on to a detailed examination of the contemporary politics of the EU -
its institutional architecture, party politics, contested legitimacy, and
ambiguous identity. The final part of the course explores an array of policy
challenges now facing Europe, including the introduction of monetary union,
the coordination of social and cultural policy, the development of a common
foreign and security policy, and expansion to the East.

****INAF 590** **International Relations in Europe**  
** Europe entered a new era with the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the
Soviet and Russian empires, and the reunification of Germany. This course
focuses on continuity and change in European international relations: on how
European state have structured their relations through time, and on the
special challenges of constructing European order after the collapse of
communism. The course explores basic issues of theorizing about international
relations, the role of the balance of power in traditional relations among
European states, the origins and consolidation of the Cold War stalemate in
Europe, the nature of alliances, the attempts to enhance security through
detente, and the debates over why the system collapsed. This is followed by an
investigation of the characteristics of the European order that has been
emerging over the past decade: the tensions between integration and
fragmentation, the attempts to use institutions to construct the new Europe,
and the debates over unipolarity and the role of regional integration in
contemporary international relations. **

**HIST 438** **Themes in History of Science to 1900**  
The theme for Fall 2002 is the role of science and technology in the
construction of "modernity" between 1600 and 1900. Topics include: theoretical
frameworks for constructing a history of the sciences; how science,
technology, and medicine became a part of state bureaucratic management,
economic exchange, political visions, cultural expressions, and even the
discourse, assumptions, and behavior of daily life between 1600 and 1800; and
finally, for the nineteenth century, how authority and power, gender
definitions, economic development, and the treatment of social problems were
related to new technologies and new ways of thinking about nature. Colloquium
and lecture format with weekly readings. Open to advanced undergraduates and
master's degree candidates. Doctoral candidates should register for the
companion reading course. Prerequisites: Two university-level general
education courses in history (AP advanced standing does not count).

****HIST 738** **Graduate Colloquium: 20th Century France**  
** The goal of this colloquium is to introduce graduate students to current
scholarship on some of the major issues of recent French history. Attention
will be placed on defining problems and assessing interpretations. (A reading
knowledge of French is not required.) Besides presenting an oral report,
students will write one short paper at midterm and a second, longer paper due
at the end of the semester. The latter paper (10-12 pages) will either review
the historiography of a topic or analyze a problem in depth. Some of the
topics we shall address are: World War I: Soldiers and Memory; Interwar
Decline; the Fall of France, 1940; the Vichy Syndrome; the Modernization
Paradigm; Decolonization and Immigration; France, Europe and the U.S. since
1945; the Challenge of Globalization.

****I NAF 307 The Political Economy of European Integration  (Undergraduate
Level Course)**  
**This course will give students an introduction to the issues of political
economy that the European Union (EU) must address and try to solve in the
process of European integration. The course works on two different aspects of
European economic integration. First it works on the national aspect. Students
will study and report on separate European economies so as to understand where
they resemble each other and where they differ. Second, the course will look
at the European Union itself, its background and present situation. Students
will look at what the EU is, how it got there, and what lies ahead. They will
examine basic EU structure, policies and politics. With European Monetary
union and the "Euro" having been launched on January 1, 1999, and with the new
bills and coins in circulation since January 1, 2002, students will also look
at the Euro and at the European Central Bank (ECB) and its policies. Finally
they will look at EU enlargement prospects and evaluate the proposals for
constitutional change in the light of the planned enlargement. **

**INAF 341** **The Cold War in Europe** **(Undergraduate Level Course) ** **  
****** Despite the obvious changes in Europe with the end of the Cold War,
Cold War experiences continue to influence how both theorists and policy
makers conceive of international relations in Europe. This seminar focuses on
the nature of the Cold War system in Europe, its evolution, its collapse, and
its legacies. The course is organized into three parts. The first examines the
origins of the stalemate system in Europe, how East and West each perceived
its security needs and organized to achieve these, and the compromises that
produced a consolidation. The second forces on the attempts to create
flexibility within the rigid structures of the Cold War. The final part
examines the debates over why the Cold War system collapsed and what its
legacies are for the conduct of relations in contemporary Europe. ** ** **

**ECON 387** **Economics of European Integration**  
This course will give an introduction to important economic aspects of
European Union. There will be a discussion of relevant theoretical issues and
their application to the case of EU. Policy questions will be highlighted and,
where appropriate, political economy considerations taken into account. In
particular, we will cover, among other things, the Common Market, the Common
Agricultural Policy, EU structural and regional policies, and the EU Budget. A
special focus of the course will be on European Monetary Union, with a
detailed discussion of history, design and working of EMU and the European
System of Central Banks. Prerequisites are: International Trade (143) and
International Finance (144)

**GOVT 382 Globalization**  
The idea of globalization is a contested one. Optimists point to economic
growth, democratization, and the communications revolution as signs of a more
interconnected, humane world. Pessimists warn of ecological disasters, a
destructive cultural homogeneity, and a resurgence of ethnic hatred. During
the first part of the semester, we will first examine the emergence of
globalization over the course of the 20th century, in its political, economic,
and cultural dimensions. We will then explore several related contemporary
controversies relating to globalization, including the impact of the Internet,
transnational health issues, North-South inequality, and the global
environment. Finally, with our eye on the future, we will examine the
possibilities for politics and democracy beyond the nation state through
institutions like the European Union and the UN.

**HIST 249** **Contemporary Spain: Politics, Society and Modernization**
**(Undergraduate Level Course)**  
One of the most intense and passionate debates of the recent Spanish
historiography concerns the topic of modernization. Almost forty years of
rough dictatorship (1939-1975) brought about a pessimistic collective image of
Spain, in which the historical backwardness was frequently stressed. However,
from the 80's onwards a new Spanish historiography is reviewing the topic of
the Spanish path to modernity, stressing its European pattern and discussing
the Spanish differences. This course takes up this debate focusing on the main
points related to the process of modernization. The course will be divided
into five topics, with three weeks devoted to each point: state building
process, nation and nationalism, social changes, economic modernization, and
society and politics. The course covers the period from the mid 19th century
to the present time, though not necessarily following a strict chronological
sequence, in order to offer a general overview of the main changes in
contemporary Spanish politics and society.

**HIST 347 The Urbanization of Europe (Undergraduate Level Course)  
**Over the century before World War I, Europe changed from a predominantly
agrarian to a largely urban society, a change that revolutionized the way of
life of its population. While there are considerable differences in the timing
and the nature of the urbanization process among the European nations
addressed in the course, the second half of the 19th and the early 20th
century deserve special attention because during this rather brief period,
cities not only grew faster than ever before (and ever again), but the quality
of urban life was drastically altered by a transformation of the urban
infrastructure that included the provision of health care and urban hygiene,
urban transport, urban planning and social security as well as the
introduction of new cultural institutions. In addition to this core period of
urbanization, the course will examine the long history of urban settlements in
Europe since the late middle ages, the economic and demographic preconditions
for rapid urbanization, the 20th century development of suburbanization, and
the recent emergence of global cities.

**HIST 433** **National Socialism**  
This course offers a comprehensive survey of society, culture, and politics in
Germany during the National Socialist era, from 1933 to 1945. It examines the
Nazi seizure and consolidation of power, propaganda and persecution, economic
and social change, high culture and the arts, and "everyday life" in the Third
Reich. It also explores the Third Reich at war, with particular emphasis on
the ideological commitments that eventuated in conquest, defeat, and genocide.  
[Chickering](../Faculty/Chickering.htm)

**HIST 435** **The Americanization of Europe**  
This colloquium is a historical inquiry into how America has contributed to
the transformation of Europe in the 20th century. It addresses questions like:
To what extent was America responsible for the development in Europe of
consumer society, mass culture, the market economy and democracy? Who have
been the principal agents of exporting the "American Way"? What is the
explanation for the seemingly irresistible power of Americanization? Or, is it
possible Americanization an illusion? Have Europeans successfully resisted or
domesticated what America exported? If so, have national identities,
diversity, and traditional practices been sustained? For example, it may be
argued that Germany, despite the proliferation of Hollywood movies,
McDonald's, and other products of American consumer culture, has not been
changed in any significant way. And how does Americanization relate to
Globalization? Are they one and the same process? More important, what does
this transformation mean? Is it something to regret or to applaud? For example
should we be concerned about global homogenization via the "American way" and
the loss of diversity? Above all, has Americanization contributed to anti-
Americanism-a topic of some current relevance? The colloquium begins with a
historical examination of these issues historically as a way of understanding
their origins, momentum, trajectory, and meaning. Then the contemporary
situation is studied in reading about issues like cultural imperialism and
anti-Americanism. Some of the authors to be read are Benjamin Barber and
Thomas Friedman.

**HIST 547 German Social History of the 19th and 20th Centuries  
**The course has two major aims. On the one hand it will to make the
participants familiar with the major social developments in Germany over the
last 200 years, and it will do so with a comparative perspective on German
history in mind. On the other hands it intends to introduce a wide variety of
approaches to social history, including gender history, cultural history and
alike. This is to say that a rather broad and open understanding of social
history governs the topics dealt with and the reading assigned.
Chronologically equal weight will be given to the 19th and to the 20th
centuries.

**HIST 746 Seminar: Ethnicity, Nation  & State in the Spanish World**  
Considered as a whole, the Spanish World offers a unique laboratory for the
study of the relationship among ethnicity, nation and state. From the early
19th century to the present time, several forms of relationship among
cultures, territories, and national identities have been defined in the
context of modern state building processes. In contrast with other European
states, Spain was for the first time in its constitutional history defined as
a transoceanic nation opening the way to a huge debate on the way in which a
number of peoples, cultures, and territories could share the same nation.
However much this first model proved to be unfeasible, it raised political and
constitutional problems that deeply influenced the making of the first
American republics and the state building process in Spain as well. This
Seminar deals with the historical evolution of this topic on both sides of the
Atlantic. Four main points will be discussed: the idea of a Hispanic-American
nation; the relationship between cultural pattern and political exclusion; the
question of autonomy and its relationship to races and peoples; and the
development of Basque nationalism in Spain as a reconstruction of ethnicity.

**HIST 802** **Readings in 20th Century European Intellectual History**  
The course will deal with the role of the intellectual in society and major
movements in European Intellectual History from the interwar years to the
present, including critical theory and the Frankfurt school; existentialism;
structuralism, poststructuralism, and deconstruction; postcolonialism; and
postmodernism. Readings will be by Horkheimer, Adorno, Habermas, Sartre, Levi-
Strauss, Foucault, Derrida, and other significant figures. Open to master's
and doctoral students.

****INAF 333** **Environment, Growth and Development (Undergraduate Level
Course)**  
** The eruption of environmental concerns on the public stage is now a few
decades old. Two centuries ago, the industrial revolution together with the
growing exploitation of natural resources inaugurated the strongest and
longest period of economic growth ever in the northern part of the world. For
decades, more production and consumption of goods and services seemed to mean
a better life. Economics progressively became a discipline of its own,
focusing on areas such as macroeconomics and international economics, with no
urgent need to take the environment into account, neither in the production
nor utility functions for instance. With the increasing scale of environmental
disruptions, with the growing financial or opportunity costs associated to
environmental degradation, the environment came back on the public stage.
Since the end of the 1960's in the US, the environment has become a key
element of the legislative agenda. It is now progressively making its way back
into economics and economic textbooks. This comeback of the environment in a
discipline from which it had almost disappeared since the dawn of the
classical theory is extremely interesting. On the one hand, the environment is
naturally part of economics if we consider economics as the science of
scarcity management. On the other hand, many economists are having a hard time
reintroducing the environment in their schemes of thought, because it
challenges the definitions of growth and development such as they have been
repeated by generations of economists. This course is about these intertwined
processes. It addresses the relationship between economic choices and the
environment from a triple perspective: positive economics, normative economics
and public policy. First we consider the integration of the environment into
the positive facet of economics: how can economics take the environment into
account in production processes, consumer choices, international trade and
investment? Second, we investigate to what extent environmental degradation
invites reconsideration of the normative facet of economics: how do we define
economic welfare, is there only one form of economic growth, and is it
possible to sustain any sort of economic growth? In other words, how do we
understand the concept of sustainable development and what are the
consequences of this definition in terms of public and long-term objectives.
Third, we get to the issue of public policy. As we saw, positive
(environmental) economics tells us how the economy and the environment
interact, and normative economics suggests what the economic objectives of a
society could be with respect to the environment. Public policy in this
context is at the crossroads of these two branches of economics with the wider
social and political rationales. Public policy is the science, both at the
national and global levels, of choosing economic/ecological goals and using
economic (and other) instruments in order to reach objectives defined above.

**INAF 592 Problems of Order in Contemporary Europe**  
Europe is caught between integrating and fragmenting pressures as it seeks to
build a new order after the collapse of the bipolar system. This seminar
explores the issues which lie at the heart of our ability to understand the
evolution of contemporary Europe. The common thread throughout is the link
between the problems of domestic and international order. The course begins
with an overview of how theory has explored this link and then moves on to
review the conditions created by the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union. In particular, it focuses on the weakness of the
state and the consequences thereof for accentuating conflict in the region, as
well as examining the different theoretical approaches for managing conflict
and organizing security in the new Europe.

**GOVT 578** **Contemporary Issues in German Politics**  
This course explores German politics within a broader comparative and
theoretical context. It begins with an analysis of the institutions linking
state and society in the Federal Republic and goes on to examine a series of
topical issues in greater depth. These include the fate of the welfare state,
the transformation of the party landscape and problems of political culture
and national identity. Both parts of the course will feature comparisons with
other western democracies and the application of contrasting theoretical
perspectives.

**HIST 033** **European Civilization I: Science & Technology in Daily Life
****(Undergraduate Level Course)**  
Early modern Europe was no less affected by scientific and technological
developments than our own age. Theirs was a world "turned upside down", to
borrow the words of historian Christopher Hill. This section of Euro Civ will
examine--against the background of larger social, political, and economic
transformations--the effects of science and technology on daily life from the
consequences of the Black Death in 1348 to the purposeful harnessing of
science and technology for political ends in the eighteenth century. Our story
is not one of the internal workings of science and technology but rather one
of how everyday reality--in particular the common person's repertoire of
assumptions, mental tools and equipment, and expectations--changed as a result
of science and technology. We will examine: how economic change and the
introduction of the mechanical clock into the town square altered time
consciousness; how linear perspective and European expansion and exploration
changed space consciousness; the role of the printing press in religious
reform; how the boundary between "natural" and "unnatural" shifted as a result
of science, technology, and exploration; and more generally, how authority and
power, the concept of truth, gender constructions, economic development, and
social hierarchies were related to new technologies and new ways of thinking
about nature.

**HIST 034** **European Civilization II: Science & Technology in Daily Life
****(Undergraduate Level Course)**  
The course will examine such problems as: how economic changes and the
introduction of the mechanical clock into the town square altered time
consciousness; how European expansion, exploration, and the introduction of
linear perspective in the arts changed space consciousness; how the printing
press impacted social relations (including between the sexes), literacy, the
representation of images, and the discourse of everyday life; how the boundary
between what was considered "natural" and "unnatural" shifted as a result of
science, technology, and exploration; and, more generally, how authority and
power, the concept of truth, gender constructions, economic development, and
social hierarchies were related to new technologies and new ways of thinking
about nature.

**HIST 248** **Revolution and Independence in the Spanish World**
**(Undergraduate Level Course)**  
This is an introductory course on the process that led the Spanish World into
the mainstream of the modern constitutional era. It is mainly concerned with
the relationship between nations, territories and cultures in a context of
crisis and revolution. Two processes, one of deconstruction of the ancient
Spanish empire and other of creation of a new Spanish nation and liberal
state, will be considered in order to explain the Spanish peculiarities
relating to the idea of nation and state. This course focuses on the first
challenges the Spanish nation had to face, those of the American territories.
Some issues included in this course are: the crisis of the Spanish monarchy
from the dynastic crisis of 1808 to the constitutional solution of 1812; the
development of Creole and Peninsular political thought; the federalization of
the monarchy and the ideas of autonomy and self-government; the fact and
meaning of independence; the debate on the nature of the nation in the
independence process; the situation of the Native American peoples and nations
during independence and within the new American states. The reading
assignments are in English. Although knowledge of Spanish is not necessary, it
would be helpful for further readings. The final grade is based on written
assignments. participation in class, and a final paper.

**HIST 445** **Industrial Revolution in Europe**  
The Industrial Revolution still looms large today when "the wealth and poverty
of nations" is discussed. The course aims to clarify the most important
conceptual issues involved in recent discussions of the Industrial Revolution,
convey the rich variety of industrial development in Europe (ranging from the
dominance of cotton production to that of iron and steal) and include the
social changes brought about by it. The final part of the course will discuss
the relationship between the early labor movement and the Industrial
Revolution.

**HIST 546** **History and Memory in Modern Europe**  
The reasons for the recent "memory boom" are manifold and shall be discussed
in this course. The reasons include, among others, the death of the last
survivors of the holocaust, the postmodern critique of "master narratives"
which deprivileges the historical discipline vis ид vis the plurality of
memories, and a renewed interest in identity and collective memory. The course
will begin with a comparative evaluation of some recent attempts to
(re)construct national memories for France (P. Nora, 7 vols., 1986-1992),
Italy (M. Isnenghi, 3 vols., 1997/98) and Germany (E. Francois/H. Schulze, 3
vols., 2001). It will then move on to a reconsideration of the place of World
War I in the collective memory of European nations, before turning \- in the
second half of the term - to the memorial representation of the holocaust
which has dominated the discussion of the relationship between history and
memory in Europe as well as in the U.S., albeit in different ways.

****HIST 646** **Graduate Colloquium: Topics in 20th Century European
History**  
** Rather than attempting to survey the course of recent European history,
this colloquium will focus on a dozen topics that command our attention. Some
of these subjects are quite "traditional" in their emphasis on political,
diplomatic, and economic history. Others are more avant-garde, looking to
issues like ethnicity, identity and other social-cultural problems. A
tentative sample of topics is: History, Memory and Identity; The first World
War: the Front, the Homefront and the Impact of War; Immigration, Citizenship
and Ethnicity; the Rise and Fall of the Communist Movement, 1917-89; the
Globalization Paradigm and the 20th Century; Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and
the Origins of the Cold War; Decolonization: from Colonial Wars to Post-
Colonialism; the Construction of the Atlantic Community: the U.S. and Western
Europe from 1917 to De Gaulle; Consumer Society and

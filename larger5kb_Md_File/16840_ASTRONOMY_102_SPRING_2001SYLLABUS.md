**How to use this syllabus**

Classes in Astronomy  meet from 1:10 to 2:00 PM on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday in Mara Auditorium, Masters Hall. You are expected to attend lecture!
Many details presented in the lectures will not be found in the text. Keep
your notes carefully, with a mind to using them as a prime study guide for the
course. Indeed you will want to take notes from the readings _before_ each
class meets. Suggestion: prepare a rough outline of topics that should come up
in class, so that you can better follow the lectures and so that you can
anticipate what questions you might like to have answered in class.    Don't
just read the posted outlines on the web (though that's a good idea, too).
Rather, make up your own notes based on readings and outlines.

The lectures will presuppose that you have done this reading. Insofar as is
possible, the lectures will explain and elaborate on the reading assignments,
not simply rehash them. Please ask questions during and after class to make
sure you've got your notes clear and that important points are covered. If you
don't have time after class, come by and see your instructor in his or her
office.

All assignments are from Fraknoi, Morrison and Wolff, and Fraknoi, **_VOYAGES
THROUGH THE UNIVERSE--   VOLUME II:  Stars, Galaxies, and Cosmology_**, 2nd
edition . Classes on which there will be in-class quizzes are marked on the
syllabus below. Note that there will be a midterm exam **at 7:00 PM Thursday
March 7th in Mara Auditorium.** Be sure to reserve this time. **The date and
time of the Final Exam is Thursday May 9th at 6:30 pm. _PLEASE CHECK BOTH
DATES at the beginning of the semester and make your spring   and summer
travel plans accordingly_** _._   Since you can make your travel plans early,
and since travel is a  matter of your personal choice, we do not give these
exams at alternate times! Mark the dates in your date-book, too: they are
once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.

Be sure to save this syllabus (and the other calendars and handouts), for
reference throughout the term.

COURSE OVERVIEW: This course is a demanding, high reading load seminar, not a
lecture course. It is for graduate students and upper division, willing-to-
work high-achieving undergraduates only. As used here, the "Middle East"
includes those countries from Morocco to Iran, including Turkey, Iran, and
Israel. Instruction begins with an historical introduction to the region and
discussion of concepts used to understand the interplay of Middle Eastern
political and diplomatic life, including the idea of civil society and the
security state. The social background of the area is covered, particularly
during the middle segment when the nation-states which make up the area are
analyzed in detail.

Next, the international relations of the region, including key outside powers,
are reviewed, with emphasis on the period since 1973. Key issues and problems
are noted, including arms control, water rights and economic development, and
the growth of radical Islamic fundamentalism.

Finally, foreign policy issues are brought forward. These are treated from
both the United States and the regional perspective, with a special focus on
conflict resolution efforts. The seminar concludes with a projection of Middle
East trends into the future. Students will be required to do independent
probing on key issues of analysis and policy, and will be given an opportunity
to sharpen both oral and written skills, which are useful in all walks of
life.

ATTENDANCE: This is a seminar-style course, and participation will be marked.
All credit-earning members of the class should be present. Just as in
business, government, or politics, occasionally a scheduled appointment must
be missed. In case of emergency, a phone call, e-mail message, note under our
door, message from roommate, or some other communication should precede an
absence. You are responsible for obtaining notes and information on a session
you miss.

EXAMINATIONS AND GRADING: Assuming an interest in--but not a terminal neurotic
preoccupation with--grades, the following activities will constitute the
evaluation system:

per cent of grade date due/to be taken

Student participation 10 per cent every session  
Oral Briefing 15 per cent each twice during term  
Midterm Exam 30 per cent October 24  
Policy Report 20 per cent November 28  
Final Class Test 10 per cent December 5

You will never do worse than figuring your score by the above percentages.
However, if you improve consistently from earlier exercises to the later ones,
you may do better; The instructor reserves the right to factor for improvement
over time. Letter grades will be given for all exercises. Late work will be
marked down one-third a grade a day work over four days late will not be
accepted and an "F" grade assigned, unless previously cleared with the
instructor.

POP QUIZZES:: Students are expected to do the reading before each seminar
session. If it becomes obvious that students are not doing the reading, the
instructors reserve the right to give short 5-10 minute short-answer "pop"
quizzes to check on reading diligence. These will be counted under "seminar
participation."

ORAL REPORTS: Each student will be required to do two short oral reports--one
on an analytical issue based on a book, the second on a policy problem. You
will have some selection in the subject from a list drawn up the instructor,
and timing will be based on the book/report you choose. Reports will be a
maximum of six minutes long and strictly timed. The purpose is to teach you to
make brief, pithy reports similar to those you will make all your life,
whatever you do. (You may practice your long, declamatory rambling at Two Keys
or Alfalfa's on your own time.)

MIDTERM EXAM: This will be conducted during the October 24 class for two
hours. The nature of the questions will be explained well before the exam, and
there will be some choice among questions.

  
POLICY REPORT: You must produce a policy report on an issue agreed with the
instructor. The report will be approximately 6-8 pages and due Nov. 28 at the
beginning of class. Detailed instructions will be given after the midterm.

FINAL EXAM: There will be no formal final exam; there will, however, be a
final test on the post-midterm reading during the last class on Dec. 5

SUBJECTS OF STUDY: A detailed topical syllabus follows. Students are expected
to do the readings grouped under each seminar period BEFORE the seminar
session. You are already one week behind 8-). You are encouraged, even
mandated, to search out and read additional works on subjects of particular
interest in addition to the required text readings. Suggested readings placed
on reserve where possible. A complete list of reserve readings is appended to
this syllabus--USE IT. Other materials, including the articles listed below,
are available in the reserve boxes in the Vandenbosch Lounge, room 420 in the
Patterson Office tower. Other materials may be handed out during the semester.
Events are likely to break swiftly in the region this year, and October has
traditionally be a time of war. You should also keep abreast of current
developments in the region by reading one weekly national news magazine and
one daily paper regularly, and developing familiarity with favorite internet
sites.

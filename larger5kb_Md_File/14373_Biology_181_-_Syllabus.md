**  
INTRODUCTION**  

> 31 January : General description of course and motivations for systematic
studies. Introduction to systematics and its applications. Introduction to
molecular evolution. General concepts of molecular evolution will be
refreshed, especially those that will be fundamental to the development of the
course.

>

> 5 February : Phylogenetic trees and general concepts of tree searches.
Nomenclature, representation, and basic enumerations and algorithms for tree
searches (based on optimality criteria) will be introduced. Exhaustive versus
heuristics; Wagner trees; spr and tbr. Outgroups. Consensus. Supertrees.
Optimization.

>

> 7 February : PAUP and MacClade.

**HOMOLOGY DEFINITION AND CHARACTER RECOGNITION**

> 12 February : Establishing homologies in DNA sequence data. Alignments:
Local versus global alignments; Pairwise comparisons; The Needleman and Wunsch
algorithm. Multiple sequence alignments. The N-dimensional case; The Sankoff
and Cedergren implementation; Current implementations and multiple sequence
alignment problems: Clustal and Malign.  
>

>

> 14 February : Using BLAST. Using Clustal (alignments based on a single guide
tree; topology dependence). Using Malign (alignments based on the parsimony
criterion; topology independence). Using direct optimization to generate
implied alignments: POY.  
>

>

> 19 February : Homology concepts in morphological data. Characters and
character transformations. **[Assignment #1
Due](../assignments_PDF/Assignment_1.pdf)**  
>

>

> 21 February : Generating morphological matrices. Issues on terminal taxa and
character coding.  
>

**STANDARD EXPLICIT MODEL-BASED PHYLOGENETIC METHODS**  

> 26 February : Evolutionary models and phylogeny reconstruction. Corrections
for multiple substitutions, distance methods (Jukes Cantor correction and its
more sophisticated allies).  
>

>

> 28 February : Application of model-based methods of phylogenetic
reconstruction. Maximum likelihood.  
>

>

> 5 March : Maximum likelihood. Selecting among models. Likelihood ratio
tests. **[Assignment #2 Due](../assignments_PDF/Assignment_2.pdf)**  
>

>

> 7 March : Application of explicit model-based methods.  
>

>

> 12 March : Methods based on optimality criteria. Overview and advantages
over algorithmic methods. Parsimony, traditional methods. Generalized
parsimony and special cases; Sankoff transformations; Current implementations.

**THE PRACTICALITIES OF SEARCHING TREE SPACE**  

> 14 March : Nona, POY and TNT  
>

>

> 19 March : Search strategies for large data sets: Parsimony ratchet; Tree
fusing; Tree drifting; Sectorial searches; Evolutionary algorithms. Driven
searches. **[Assignment #3 Due](../assignments_PDF/Assignment_3%20doc.pdf)**[  
>  ](../assignments_PDF/Assignment_3%20doc.pdf)

>

> 21 March : Parsimony, non-traditional methods. Direct optimization; Fixed-
states optimization. TNT and POY

**LESSER KNOWN PHYLOGENETIC METHODS; COMPARISONS**  

> 2 April : Paralinear distances/LogDet, Hadamard, and evolutionary parsimony
(invariants) methods.  
>

>

> 4 April : Paralinear distances/LogDet, Hadamard, Evolutionary parsimony
(invariants) methods.  
>

>

> 9 April : General discussion and comparison of Maximum Likelihood and
Parsimony methods. Are they really that different? Branch lengths. Consistency
and the Felsenstein-Farris zones. **[Assignment #4
Due](../assignments_PDF/Assignment_4.pdf)**  
>

>

> 11 April : Comparing methods of phylogenetic inference: Accuracy,
consistency, speed.

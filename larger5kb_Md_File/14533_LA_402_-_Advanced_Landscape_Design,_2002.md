Final Presentations  
LA 402: Advanced Landscape Design  
Winter 2002  
  
Wednesday, 20th March 2002  
University Union: Sierra Madre Room & Mt. Baldy Room  
  

This quarter students in Advanced Landscape Design addressed the challenge of
Energy Independence as a way of learning to do more ecosystem based design.
Each project conceived ways to conserve and harvest renewable energy creating
more sustainable urban landscapes. To learn more about the profession, each
student identified their role as a landscape architect addressing this
challenge within the context of a real site and situation. The following is a
brief description of these community service projects: The students will
present these projects on Wednesday, March 20, 2002 in the University Union,
Mark von Wodtke's section in the Sierra Madre Room and Jerry Taylor's section
in the Mt. Baldy Room.  
  
**Sierra Madre Room presentations  
Mark von Wodtke, Professor Emeritus**

8:00 am Nathan Gipple, Consultant, First Family Church, Whittier  
Church Gymnasium: A Second Chance  
The re-design of the outdoor space around the building could enhance the
microclimate and provide a node for bicycles, scooters, skateboards and small
electric vehicles that might use the bikeway being planned along the old rail
line at the edge of the property. The building could be remodeled to provide
natural daylighting, more efficient heating and air conditioning, and solar
electricity and could also have a green roof that would improve energy
efficiency.

8:15 am Jennifer Sarna, Staff Person, Federal Environmental Protection Agency  
Restoring our Future and Preserving our Past  
Glacier National Park serves as a poster child for Global Warming-glaciers
will soon disappear from the park. This awareness can help to drive change to
renewable energy using wind and solar resources. This project provides
guidelines and examples for making that change.

8:30 Angela Mlakar, Researcher, Applied Ecological Systems  
Real Goods Water Reclamation and Demonstration Plan  
This project uses reclaimed water from the Hopland Public Utility District
Sanitation Plan on the adjacent Real Goods site. It provides a variety of
demonstrations for educating the public on ways of using reclaimed water.
These ideas can be applied to residential and commercial sites to help
conserve water and the energy needed for moving it. Real Goods could provide
products needed for these applications.

8:45 Hamid Ghomi, Entrepreneur  
Hot Springs Leisure World  
Located near the beautiful wine country of Temacula, assessable from the
Interstates 15 and 215, is affordable property that could be developed into a
retirement community. The site is well situated to use solar, wind, and
geothermal energy, providing comfort and amenities on a more sustainable
basis, protecting retired people on fixed incomes from increasing energy
costs.

9:00 Dave Melio, Entrepreneur  
Port of Long Beach Pier "H" Passenger Terminal  
This project integrates sustainable design ideas into a contemporary
commercial design. Solar collectors and wind generators on site produce
electricity for the cruise ships so they do not have to use their polluting
diesel generators when in the harbor. Solar electric production for other
commercial venues can also provide shade for parking. Water Taxis, public
transit, and bicycle trails can connect the passenger terminal and attractions
at this site (such as the Queen Mary) to other attractions such as Rainbow
Harbor and downtown Long Beach.

9:15 am Nathan Bluhm, Advocate for the California Experience  
Pacific Coast Highway-Orange County Master Plan 2020: Phase III  
This project enhances the California Experience by reducing dependence on the
automobile and providing people with more pleasurable pathways to access the
coast between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach. Greater energy independence can
be achieved by improving pedestrian and bicycle access, reducing traffic
congestion and the need for more parking, while better managing storm runoff
to protect coastal aquatic ecosystems.

9:30 am Miguel Beltran, Consultant to the Institute of Municipal Planning
(IMPLAN) Tijuana, Mexico  
Puerta Mexico  
A design to improve the Mexican border entrance at Tijuana could address
functional and aesthetic considerations. Shifting to more bus, train, bicycle,
and pedestrian access reduces congestion and air pollution at the gateways,
while reducing dependence on fossil fuels. A design that permits autos to turn
off their engines and coast up to the checkpoint also reduces emissions and
fuel consumption. A pedestrian plaza with restaurants and other amenities
could make a pleasant stopping point to purchase auto insurance and souvenirs.

9:45 Jesus Castellanos, Advocate  
Rapid Bus Line  
This project advocates providing a Rapid Bus Line between LAX and Downtown Los
Angeles. Clean fuel cell powered buses could have station platforms to speed
loading and unloading and run on dedicated lanes that have sensors to
automatically trip signals and crossings. If it took less time to travel to
and from the Airport by Rapid Bus, than by automobile, people would make more
use of public transit that helps reduce congestion, air pollution, and
dependence on fossil fuels.

10:00 Break

10:15 am John Palisin, Advocate  
The Orange Line Project  
The proposed Orange Line could connect Santa Ana to La Verne with stops at the
Pond, San Diego Transit Line, Cal State Fullerton, Brea Park and Ride, Cal
Poly Pomona/Mt Sac and Downtown Pomona. This light rail line would bring
people to jobs in Orange County and Educational Institutions in Inland Cities,
enabling people in the region to move more easily north and south as well as
east and west.

10:30 am Eric Freeman, Entrepreneur  
Inside Out  
This development proposes an outdoor recreation area that incorporates nature
and art to provide workouts that are more interesting. The site is located in
Orange County near The Pond and shares parking with that facility. It is
accessible from the 57 Freeway as well as the Santa Ana River Bike trail. It
is also located near a stop on the proposed Orange Line.

10:45 am Moran Yotzer, Consultant,  
Access for the University of Cal State Fullerton  
The plan provides for a Red Car "trolley" that will run on the major streets
around the campus enabling students and local residents to access major nodes
on the Cal State Fullerton Campus as well as old town Fullerton, Old Town
Brea, and major shopping plazas in the area. It could also connect to the
Orange Line light rail station that could be located along the 57 Freeway near
the University campus. Better public transit access could reduce vehicular
congestion and energy consumption.

11:00 am Alan Pan and Paul Chapek, Entrepreneurs,  
El Paseo, La Verne  
There is an opportunity to develop a pedestrian transit node around a train
station that would serve the City of La Verne, the University of La Verne, and
Los Angles County Fairplex. This station could provide a stop for the present
MTA line that goes from Union Station to San Bernardino. It could also be a
stop on the Gold Line now being planned from Pasadena to Claremont. In
addition, the station might serve a future Orange Line that would connect to
Orange County. El Paseo La Verne provides a plan for this new transportation
hub that could include restaurants, commercial, office, and residential space
as well as a large park-and-ride facility making use of parking at the
Fairplex.

11:15 am Jason Soltero, Artist  
Public Art Installation for the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA)  
This art installation for a new transit station at La Verne could express both
physical and spiritual energy creating a special place. People can experience
this installation when moving through the station. It would enhance the
public's awareness of solar electricity and could become a special place where
school children come by train on field trips for an enjoyable educational
experience.

11:30 am Jeff Trojanowski, Freelance Writer for 210 Magazine  
Access: La Verne  
This three-article series is based on the past, present, and future access,
and how it shapes the City of La Verne. The first article looks at how the
railroad and Red Car helped form the City. The next article reviews the
influence of the automobile that spawned development along Route 66 (Foothill
Boulevard) sprawling suburbs and the extension of the 210 Freeway (Route 30).
The final article envisions what could happen with pedestrian pockets, bicycle
trails, multi-modal transportation that could make La Verne much more energy
independent, while reducing congestion, and improving air quality.



**Mt. Baldy Room Presentations  
Gerald O. Taylor, ASLA, Assistant Professor**

8:00 am Jennifer Liguori, Consultant, The Long Beach Greenbelt Committee &
Friends of the Colorado Lagoon  
_Long Beach Commons  
_ This presentation is of a community enhancement plan for a former Pacific
Electric Railroad right-of-way in Long Beach, California. The goal is to
transform the 11.3 acres of vacant land to a landscaped greenway for the
benefit of the surrounding communities. The improved open space will create a
link to the park at Colorado Lagoon, through Belmont Heights and to other
neighborhoods. The design will feature measures to improve water quality
affecting the Lagoon, a multi-use trail system, committee gathering space,
community gardens, and a native plant demonstration garden. The presentation
is to offer a vision of what could result from a concentrated effort by the
two organizations and members of the community.

8:15 am: Rama Nayeri, Consultant, Turtle Rock Community Park Nature Center  
_Turtle Rock Community Park Nature Center Renovation Project_  
Turtle Rock Community Nature Center has a variety of plant communities in its
5-acre nature trail, such as riparian, oak woodland, desert, and costal sage
scrub. However, the nature center is looking into renovating their plant
communities. The problem begins with how do they go about such a project.
Their plant communities are not diverse enough in plant selection and the
local wildlife have nearly destroyed the current irrigation system, which
poses another problem. Currently the staff is doing all they can to maintain
the nature canter but unfortunately there is only so much that they can do.
Furthermore, the pathways at the nature trail do not meet ADA standards. I
intend to provide a design for the nature center that will not only increase
the native plantings but also become beneficial to the native habitat. As a
Landscape Architect I am concerned that in time, the nature center will
depreciate in quality. My long term goal is to improve the nature center
(through funding) by enacting a renovation (restoration) plan for the nature
center that not only brings the center up to code but also ads more variety to
the native plant selection. Through this project, I intend to not only raise
awareness to the native landscape and habitat but also raise awareness of
energy and water conservation.

8:30 Melaine Rodriguez & Lorena Guevera-Salvador, Consultants, City of Anaheim  
_City of Tomorrow_  
This project is based on a need for the city of Anaheim to improve its
transportation system and pollution while at the same time addressing the
needs to conserve the remaining natural environment and open green space.  
In order to meet these objectives, we worked with regenerative means of
transportation, energy and a new innovative style of living and in the process
creating a sustainable environment where people can live, work, and play
without harming the environment.

8:45 Lee Do and Michael Salazar, Consultants, The City of Rancho Cucamonga  
_Rancho Cucamonga Regional Park_  
The design firm of Stewart and Whitmann is pleased to present its proposed
solution for the Regional Park to the City of Rancho Cucamonga. We believe
that our design will not only prove to be environmentally responsible, but
will also prove to be cost effective.

9:00 Solomon Tingsam Li, consultant, Chinese Christian alliance church  
_CCAC Landscape "Design for the Future"_  
In the 21st century, churches are growing, expanding, and demanding a design
that will fit their needs. How do we approach planning and designing for the
21st century church? What are their goals? How can we accommodate their needs
as well as the needs of the neighborhood? What kind of design is appropriate
for God's people as "stewards" of the land? What kinds of solutions are needed
to approach problems of crime, noise, energy, and outreach into the community?
Come and find out.

9:15am: Sarah Musumano, designer, Huntington Memorial Hospital patients and
staff  
_Therapeutic Garden at Huntington Memorial Hospital_  
I am proposing to design and build a therapeutic garden for the patients,
staff, and visitors of Huntington Memorial Hospital. Through the use of this
garden I am hoping that the users will gain a sense of peace, solace, joy and
most importantly healing. I am interested in designing this space to be
ecologically sound, though am even more interested that it be emotionally
regenerative. I hope I am successful!

9:30 am: Bryan Love, Garry Villanueva, Hung Lu, Researchers, City of Hot
Springs  
In this project, we are trying to create a place in the Hot Springs Desert
that will house around 100 people. This community will be there conducting
research about the living environment in a desert setting using only natural
resources and as little energy as possible. This place will also be open for
the public to come and be educated on what the residence are doing.

9:45 Steve Hartman, Advocate, California State Parks Commission  
_Crystal Cove Historical Preservation_  
This project is a proposal for the Historical Preservation of Crystal Cove
State Park in Laguna Beach, California. The project focuses on saving an
important part of the California coastal experience. This California
experience is being lost as, one by one, the little towns along the Pacific
Coast Highway are torn down and replaced by housing tracts, shopping centers
and hotels/resorts. While putting in the effort to save this coastal
community, we are also incorporating regenerative design ideas in hopes that
visitors will leave the part having learned about the importance of both
historical preservation and regenerative design.

10:00 Break

10:15 am Kamala Klein & Vanessa Advincula, Environmental Artists
(Studioscapes), Cathedral City Redevelopment Agency  
_Cancer Awareness Park_  
At Studioscapes we believe the strength of our designs are determined through
our interaction with the people who impact the earth. Our projects are
exciting and energetic. Our team carefully considers the sense of place as
well as understanding the goals of the client upon project completion.  
The Cancer Awareness Park is one such project that Studioscapes is honored to
work on. The emotional aspects we wish to put forth in our design are achieved
by understanding the environment and community involvement. The Cancer
Awareness Park is one of Studioscapes most celebrated projects. We hope our
design achieves a connection through physical and psychological emotions in
order to optimize the experience of cancer awareness.

10:30 am Iliana Mendez & Alice Pelais, Consultants, Serenity Infant Care Homes  
_A Children's Therapeutic Garden_  
Serenity Infant Care Homes is a non-profit agency providing quality foster
care home for abused, abandoned, and neglected infants, toddlers, and
children. The agency's therapeutic leaning center is comprised of two unique
programs, early intervention for infants, and a therapeutic program for
preschool age children.  
Our project will focus on a design of a therapeutic garden that will
complement the agency's therapeutic program. The purpose of the garden is to
reduce the damaging effects of neglect, abuse, and abandonment. The natural
environment will be designed to maximize the child's physical, emotional,
social, and intellectual development.  
The garden will mainly be focused on a sustainable and regenerative design. We
feel that it is important to meet the needs of today's generation without
diminishing the ability of future generations needs. It is important to
provide a sustainable and regenerative design because as we are making better
use of the landscape resources, we are also regenerating positive emotions,
especially trust, in foster children.

10:45am Desiree Norris, Consultant, California State Polytechnic University,
Pomona  
_Parking Lots J & M Improvements_

11:00 am Daniel Lopez, Yupil Chon, Brian Groves, Janis Lee, Consultants and
Designers, Port Authority of New York City  
_World Trade Center_  
The tragedy of September 11, 2001 has had an immeasurable effect on the people
of New York, the United States, and of the world. It was an event full of
tragedy, innocent loss, and of heroes, and unity. To remember the people
involved and affected by the event and to attempt to restore the area of the
attack to its former importance as a center of financial business, there is a
need to design and develop a new vision with sustainability for the former
World Trade Center site. The scope of work is the design of a memorial for the
World Trade Center bombing, the placement of a site for a new building, and
the design and planning of the overall site.

11:15 am Christina Cobbs, Ernie Aguilera, Sara Hsing...ACH Associates,
Consultants, City of Orange  
_ADA improvements for El Modena Park and Belmont Park_  
Our goal is to implement ADA standards into these parks and provide a more
invitable atmosphere for people of all ages and abilities. We are hoping to
create a sense of place at these parks from the surrounding neighborhoods. In
the end we hope to use these designs as a template for the parks in the entire
Orange County area.

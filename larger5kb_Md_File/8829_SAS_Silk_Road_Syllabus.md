**COURSE SYLLABUS, FALL 1999. Meeting time: A days, 1045 to 1200.**



**COURSE DESCRIPTION.** The Silk Road was the world's first great
superhighway, linking China and Japan to the Mediterranean World across
Central Asia from ancient times, via caravans and bazaars. The peoples along
the way not only traded luxury goods, but also ideas, religions, art, culinary
and musical traditions. This course offers an entirely new way to look at the
ancient and medieval art of Eurasia, as we travel with Marco Polo. Through
lectures, reading, site visits and films, we will explore the trade links
between East and West, and the art associated with those routes. Primary-
source literature will help us understand the great ideas and movements of the
times-Buddhism, Islam, the Indian royal epics, Christian crusading and Mongol
expansion. We will try to see monuments of the great trading regions through
the eyes of travelers who were seeing these things for the first time-as we
will be. This course requires no previous experience, but is intended those
who like interdisciplinary approaches to art and travel. No previous
coursework is required.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**

  * To introduce students to the art of ancient and medieval Eurasia in a way that stresses the links, as well as the differences, between traditions.
  * To examine the history of cultural interactions between East Asia and the Mediterranean world, from Roman times until the present day, through the evidence of art and architecture.
  * To expose students to some of the great classics of travel literature and fiction, and to use them as primary sources for art history.
  * To offer students a historical perspective on travel, trade, and geography, and their impact on human culture.
  * To provide practice in thinking, reading, and writing about historical art and architecture.

**TENTATIVE FIELD REQUIREMENTS.** At each port, students will visit
significant monuments of art and architecture, museum collections,
ethnographic museums, historic sites, and, wherever possible, neighborhoods of
working artisans. Students will be given specific field assignments in port
that will involve looking, recording, and analysis in comparison to material
in the assigned readings. Students are required to participate in a minimum of
three practica, from the list below or devised with the consent of the
instructor. Since this is an art and architecture course, a major feature of
the course will be your own observations of buildings and art in the places we
visit. At least one of the practica must be a visit to an architectural
monument, either independently or with a group. At least one of the practica
must be a visit to a museum collection of Asian or Greco-Roman art in one of
the cities you visit. At least one must to be a major pre-modern commercial
trade facility.Three of the practica will be written up for 10% of the course
grade. A fourth may be part of your research project. Individualized field
requirements may be proposed and substituted for these, upon my approval.

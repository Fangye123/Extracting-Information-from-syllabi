of the people of various cultures in today's world, their political systems,
national aspirations and the quest for world peace.

religion has had upon the society/societies which support it, and speculate
what contributions its teachings cold make to the resolution of some current
world problems.

**OTHER COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

Each student will develop and submit a Religious **Genogram** , tracing their
religious heritage back at least three generations (to great-grandparents),
noting denominational, cultural, geographic and ethnic emphasis on how the

Genogram should be in the form of a chart (1 page) and a narrative (1 or more
pages).

with the Instructor via email and/or listserv as applicable. Online "lecture"

subject matter; individual and group presentations of assigned projects;
weekly open-book quizzes; class interest and participation.

**ASSIGNMENT of GRADES:**

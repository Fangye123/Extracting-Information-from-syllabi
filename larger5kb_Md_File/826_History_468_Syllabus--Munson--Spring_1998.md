### Course Requirements:

Two take-home mid-term exams, a final exam, and a research paper are the
written requirements for this course. In addition, each student will give a
class presentation as part of the process of preparing the research paper (see
below). This presentation will be graded together with the research paper,
which will receive an automatic zero if not accompanied by an oral
presentation. Failure to complete any of the written requirements will be
regarded as a failure to complete the course, and will therefore result in an
automatic grade of F. Each student will prepare a statement of his or her
paper topic, with projected bibliography. This statement will not be graded,
but failure to hand it in will result in a loss of seven points on the final
grade. Papers received in the week after the due date, 5 p.m. on April 3, will
be marked down up to one full grade. _Absolutely no papers will be accepted
after 5 p.m. on April 10._  
  
Exams must be turned in by the deadline. Extensions and make-ups will be
arranged only by prior consent of the instructor, and only for the most
compelling reasons (as determined by the instructor). If a student, without
gaining prior consent, is unable to take an exam due to sudden illness or some
other extraordinary event, the instructor must be notified immediately. If I
cannot be reached directly or by phone, you must leave a message with the
History Department. A student's request for an extension or make-up must be
accompanied by a doctor's note or other written documentation.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Exams:

The exams are all essay. The mid-terms will contain two essays, the final exam
three, of which one will be comprehensive in nature (covering the entire
course). General issues that are likely to be the subject of essay questions
will be covered in the review sessions indicated on your weekly schedule, but
the exams may contain other material not discussed in these sessions. The
exams will be designed to test acquaintance both with the readings and points
raised in class. The instructor will be looking for evidence of general
knowledge, an organized and analytical approach to that knowledge, and an
ability to combine the raw materials of the course -- text, discussions, and
documentary sources -- into pertinent and meaningful insights. The instructor
will also be evaluating your ability to communicate those insights. Points
will be taken off for run-on sentences, grammatical errors, spelling errors,
poor punctuation, illegible handwriting or any other problems that, in the
opinion of the instructor, affect comprehension of the student's work. Strive
above all for clarity. The two mid-terms must be prepared on a word-processor,
with margins, fonts and other physical characteristics conforming to the
requirements for the research paper. The final will be taken in class (bring a
blue book), and will be three hours long.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Grading:

The mid-terms, the final, and the paper are worth 100 points each. Your final
grade will be determined by the total number of points you gain out of a
maximum of 400, as modified by your class participation grade (see below). I
do not grade on a curve. Attendance, in addition to evidence of progress or
lack thereof in the course of the semester, will be factors in deciding half
grades and borderline cases (which, experience shows, means most students).
Serious attendance problems or misconduct in class can result in a lowering of
grade. The grading scale is as follows:  
  
Score / Grade:  
388-400=A+  
372-387=A  
360-371=A-  
348-359=B+  
332-347=B  
320-331=B-  
308-319=C+  
292-307=C  
280-291=C-  
268-279=D+  
252-267=D  
240-251=D-  
Below 240=F

### Extra-Credit Assignments:

Extra-credit assignments may be arranged with the instructor. These
assignments must be approved in advance by the instructor on or before March
6, and will not be accepted unless so approved. They are worth a maximum of 40
points. Under no circumstances will an extra-credit assignment be accepted as
substitute for any other written requirement in the course. An extra-credit
assignment can only elevate a student into a higher grade bracket (for
example, from a B to an A) if the student has scored the higher grade on at
least one of the three major exams or on the presentation/paper. The
assignment must take the form either of an analytical book review (not a book
summary) 5-7 pages in length, or a second documented paper 7-10 pages in
length, and must utilize sources not assigned in this course. Style of text,
footnotes, bibliography and title page must conform to the guidelines of
Turabian. If you decide to do an extra-credit assignment, it must be turned in
no later than April 10 for you to receive credit.

### Attendance Policy:

Class attendance is a requirement of this course. Repeated unexcused absences
will lead to a reduction of grade. Unexcused absences totaling 25% or more of
the class meetings will result in an automatic F for the course. The
instructor will excuse a student only under the most extraordinary
circumstances. Chronic lateness will also be penalized, since it presents a
class disturbance. If a student arrives after roll is taken, it is the
student's responsibility to place his or her name on the class roll no later
than the end of that class period. Failure to do so will result in an
unexcused absence, even if the student later produces class notes or other
evidence that he or she was present for all or part of the class period.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Class Participation:

Since this is a discussion class, class participation on the part of all
students is vital. Students must arrive prepared to discuss the reading
assignments. In order to ensure this, I will choose one or two students at
random at the beginning of each class to be discussion leaders. Those students
will be graded for their contributions to the discussion that day. Any who
have not read the material or who are absent without prior clearance from me
will receive a failing grade for that day's discussion. I will arrange it so
that everyone gets a more or less equal chance to be "on call". Voluntary
contributions from students not designated by this system will of course be
viewed positively, especially when they demonstrate acquaintance and
engagement with the reading. Your overall grade for class participation will
not be figured numerically into your final score, but will weigh heavily
nonetheless. It will be used to decide borderline cases, offset negative
trends like absences, or, if judged to be above your performance on written
work, bump you to a higher grade. A "B" student who performs at a "B" level in
class will still get a "B", or, at most, a "B+", depending on other factors.
But a "B" or "B+" student making "A" contributions in class significantly
increases his or her chances of an "A-", depending on other circumstances. A
student whose contributions in class are few or show shallow acquaintance with
the readings can expect negative consequences, even with all "A's" on the
written assignments. More than most classes, a discussion-oriented class can
succeed only when the students themselves make a consistent effort. I reserve
the right if necessary to assign oral reports to facilitate discussion, and to
use these reports in the determination of final grades.

### Honor Code and Plagiarism:

Students are expected to observe the honor code. All work for this course must
be pledged. Students found to have cheated on an exam or to have plagiarized
material in a paper will be subject to the maximum penalty under college
rules. For those in doubt about the definition of plagiarism, it consists of
copying passages from a source without both attribution **and** quotation. If
you have reproduced the language of your source, you have committed plagiarism
whether or not you have cited the source and the page number. This includes
passages that a student may have modified: for example, changed verb tenses,
omission or replacement of occasional words, reshuffling of phrases, sentences
or paragraphs, combining of different plagiarized sources. Writing a bad paper
in your own words is far better than writing a good one using the words of
someone else. One suggestion for avoiding inadvertent echoing of your texts
and sources: close all books when writing, and consult them only for specific
facts or direct quotes. Also, proofread your paper with plagiarism
specifically in mind.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Taperecording and Class Decorum:

Taperecording of lectures is not permitted. Students who are excused from
class by the instructor must make arrangements with the instructor or with
other students to cover the material missed. Students who skip class without
permission are responsible for making their own arrangements with other
students (not with the instructor) for the material covered in class.  
  
Students are expected to observe class decorum. Students engaging in behavior
bothersome to other students or to the instructor (for example, eating or
drinking, talking in class or the use of personal stereos) will be asked to
leave and marked as absent. By order of the department chair, food and drinks
are not permitted in the classroom.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Research Paper:

The research paper is designed specifically to show that the student can
research a topic and develop an analytical argument using source materials.
The emphasis should be as much as possible on using primary source materials
from the period in question -- the writings of Marx or Darwin, not just
writings about them, beginning with the two required sourcebooks. All students
should meet with the instructor about their paper topics, and do so as early
as possible in the semester. Each student will prepare a one-page written
statement of his or her paper topic, complete with bibliography, by the
beginning of week three. These will then be distributed to other students in
the class, each of whom will prepare a written critique due by the beginning
of week five. Neither of these assignments will be graded, but failure to
complete either assignment will result in a deduction of seven points from the
final grade.  
  
As part of the research project, each student will give an oral presentation
based on their term paper of fifteen minutes in length. In the class period
preceding the presentation, each presenter will give a written outline to the
other students in the class as a basis for class discussion after the
presentation. Class time will be set aside in the middle of the semester for
these presentations, with the specific time slots to be determined at random
by the instructor. Think of these presentations as a trial run for your paper
in progress, and an opportunity to get critical feedback. The oral
presentation and the paper will be graded as one assignment. I will be looking
in particular for signs of improvement or refinement between the oral report
and the final written product.  
  
The final papers must be printed on a word-processor, with double-spaced text,
a title page, and one-inch (and no more than one-inch) margins. The text (not
including bibliography, title page and endnotes page) should be no less than
10 full pages and no more than 12 pages in length. Your name, the course name
and number, and the date must be on the title page. It must include a
bibliography of all sources cited. You may use either endnotes or footnotes,
but if you use the latter, the paper must be sufficiently over the 10 page
limit to compensate for the formatting of the notes at the foot of the page.
Bibliography and footnote or endnote citations must conform to the proper
style for the liberal arts, as defined in Kate Turabian, A Manual for Writers
of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations, Chicago, 1987. Do not use MLA, APA
or any alternative style current in other disciplines. Unless you wish to see
the instructor fly into a blind rage, do not even think of using parenthetical
notes.  
  
The type of material that must be documented (i.e. footnoted) includes:
controversial or distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are not a
matter of broad general knowledge, statistics, all quotes, and paraphrases or
summaries of an author's argument. All direct quotes over two lines in length
must be indented and single-spaced as described in Turabian. You should have
at least one footnote per full page of text.  
  
It is imperative that you document source material, but the argument or thesis
of your paper must be in your own words: excessive use of quotes or lengthy
paraphrasing of sources will not be accepted, and leads easily to the grievous
sin of plagiarism. On plagiarism, see under "Honor Code" above. The citation
of at least five different sources is a minimal requirement for the paper. In
addition to the assigned texts, which you are required to cite, you must
utilize at least three other sources from the library. These sources should be
scholarly works of article or book length, and/or additional primary sources.
You may use encyclopedias or other reference works, but they should not be
cited, nor will they be considered a proper substitute for the outside sources
required.

### CORRECT FORM FOR TERM PAPERS

Students should NOT use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do NOT use parenthetical notes!! Only footnotes and endnotes will be
acceptable! Please consult Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_. 6th ed.  
  
Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a term paper.  
  
The following are some useful examples from Turabian:  
  
Footnoting a book:  
  
    **1 Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London: George Allen and Unwin, l938), 33.**

  
  
If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,  
  
    **2 Ibid., 37.** (Note that Ibid. is not underlined)  
  
If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,  
  
    **17 Waley, _The Analects_ , 130.**  
  
Footnoting an article or selection in an edited anthology or book of readings:  
  
    **3 Klemens von Metternich, "Political Confession of Faith," in Brian Tierney and Joan Scott, eds., _Western Societies: A Documentary History_ , 2 vols. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984), 2: 239.**  
( _Note that in the above example, the number of volumes in the book appears
after the title and the specific volume from which the citation came appears
before the page number at the end._ )  
  
If a different article or selection is cited from the same anthology, students
should use the following form:  
  
    **9 Thomas Malthus, "First Essay on Population," in Tierney and Scott, eds., _Western Societies_ , 2: 144.**  
  
  
Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
  
    **3 Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ , vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization_ , ed. John W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, l986), 402.**  
  
Footnoting a Review:  
  
    **4 Steven Spitzer, review of _The Limits of Law Enforcement_ , by Hans Zeisel, in _American Journal of Sociology_ 91 (November l985): 726-29.**  
  
Footnoting a Journal:  
  
    **8 Don Swanson, "Dialogue with a Catalogue," _Library Quarterly_ 34 (December l963): ll3-25.**  
  
Electronic Documents (ONLY IF APPROVED BY INSTRUCTOR IN ADVANCE)

Footnoting a Magazine;  
  
    **9 Anne B. Fisher, "Ford Is Back on the Track," _Fortune_ , 23 December l985, l8.**  
  
Footnoting a Newspaper:  
  
     **10 Michael Norman, "The Once-Simple Folk Tale Analyzed by Academe," _New York Times_ , 5 March l984, p. l5**  
  
Bibliography: Your bibliography should be entitled "Works Cited," and it
should only include works which you have cited in your footnotes/endnotes.

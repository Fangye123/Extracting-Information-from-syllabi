COURSE PURPOSES

**

This is the second of two pro-seminar courses required of all entering
students in the doctoral program in Curriculum, Teaching, and Educational
Policy. The course is intended to:

  * help you continue to develop your advanced skills in critical reading, analytical writing, and thoughtful collegial discussion;

  * ask you to confront fundamental issues in education, especially as they relate to teacher's learning and teachers' work

  * give you familiarity with central lines of research on teacher learning and teachers' work.

**

COURSE REQUIREMENTS

**

The Centrality of Analytical Writing: The entire grade for this course depends
on the quality of each student's work on the written assignments that are
defined below. (While we strongly encourage students to participate in
discussions in class, this participation is not graded.) One central purpose
of this course is to encourage students to develop their skill at producing
effective analytical writing. This skill is essential for anyone who wishes to
be successful in meeting the requirements of doctoral study (courses,
comprehensive exams, and dissertation) and who expects to have an impact in
the intellectual and professional world of education. Effective analytical
writing is essential for all of these tasks, and this course (like any
doctoral course) is a good place to work on enhancing your abilities in this
realm.

To help you out in thinking about the basic characteristics of good analytical
writing, we have written a set of "Basic Guidelines for Writing Analytical
Papers," which is being distributed as a separate handout. We suggest that you
read this carefully and consult it when you are writing papers for this
course. For a more in-depth discussion of the nature of scholarly writing and
the best ways to carry it out effectively, we suggest that you consult a book
by Wayne C. Booth et al., _The Craft of Research_ (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press, 1995), which is available in a softbound edition at the MSU
Bookstore in the International Center (in the section on Style Manuals). This
book is an excellent source of information about the whole process of
conceptualizing, designing, carrying out, analyzing, and writing about
research. But for the purposes of this course, its greatest value is in its
careful discussion (complete with lots of examples) of the process of
effective analytical writing -- constructing arguments, supporting them with
data and/or literature, and putting all this together into a persuasive text.
The authors provide valuable information about both the nitty-gritty of
writing (citation, how to use quotations, etc.) and the larger conceptual
issues that surround effective analysis. There is also another book that we
would recommend, Howard S. Becker's _Tricks of the Trade: How to Think about
Research While You're Doing It_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988).
As the title suggests, he focuses less on the issue of writing than on the
even knottier issue of how to conceptualize problems that are worth writing
about. He provides a lot of useful tips and examples of ways in which you can
learn to approach issues so that you will be able to provide an analysis that
will be interesting and insightful (in contrast to the pedestrian and
unenlightening work that often passes for scholarship).

**

Critical Reaction Papers (1/3)** : You are required to write six short
reaction papers. Since there are twelve class meetings for which reading is
assigned, this will mean writing a reaction paper roughly every other week. In
each of these papers you should provide a brief critical response to some
significant issue encountered in the assigned readings for a particular week.
You are not being asked to summarize the argument of individual readings,
although your discussion should reveal that you have understood what this
argument is. Instead you should react to the reading(s) as a critical observer
with a specific frame of reference (derived from the course, from your reading
elsewhere, and/or from your own experience). You don't need to respond to a
whole book or the whole array of readings for a particular week. Pick a _major
issue_ from the reading that grabs your attention and briefly develop it. (A
focused discussion of one issue works better in a short paper like this than
an effort to cover a number of different issues.) Feel free to make
connections with other things you know, but be sure that you draw on the
reading from that week for some of your evidence or ideas or examples. You
will be evaluated on the basis of the thoughtfulness, depth of understanding,
and analytical insight that is reflected in your paper. These papers should be
turned in on the day the particular reading(s) will be discussed in class.
They should be approximately two to three pages in length (500 to 800 words),
typed and double-spaced. They can run longer, if you wish, but this is not
necessary. We encourage you to send these reaction papers to us by e-mail --
either by pasting your paper into an e-mail letter or by sending it as an
attachment.: You are required to write six short reaction papers. Since there

send these reaction papers to us by e-mail -- either by pasting your paper
into an e-mail letter or by sending it as an attachment.

We have two aims in asking you to write these weekly papers. First, they will
encourage you to keep up with the reading and to come to class with some
already-formulated thoughts about the reading. This course will be run as a
seminar, with students sharing responsibility for the conduct of the class.
This means you should come in every week with a set of questions and comments
and issues that you developed while doing the week's readings, and you should
be prepared to draw on these insights selectively in a constructive effort to
help shape seminar discussion. The critical reaction papers help facilitate
this kind of preparation and thereby help promote an informed and broad-based
discussion of the issues in class each week. (As noted earlier, participation
in such discussions is encouraged but not graded.) Second, these short papers
will provide you, at the end of the term, with a set of elaborated notes on
course issues and readings that should serve as a useful resource when you
write your final paper, when you encounter related issues in your future work,
or when you want to revisit some of the readings at a later point. You may
want to use these papers to write a running commentary on the issues in the
course, with your individual papers building on each other from week to week
-- perhaps from the standpoint of a particular subject matter or a particular
perspective on schooling. You may want to try out ideas in these papers that
you will later develop in a final paper for the course. Also, you may want to
use these papers as a way to hold an ongoing conversation with us about
readings, schools, and teaching.

Mid-Term Synthesis Paper (1/3)** : At the middle of the semester, we will ask
all students to answer a question that requires you to synthesize what you
have learned from the reading and discussion in the first part of the course
and to apply this understanding to an important issue in education. We will
explain this assignment in more detail when we hand out the question. This is
the kind of question you will have to answer in a comprehensive examination,
and the skills that are required are similar. Comps questions ask you to
synthesize ideas across an array of literature and apply this understanding to
analysis of a major question in the field. You will receive the question in
class on _February 23_ and it will be due in class on _March 2._ Required
(minimum) length: 12 pages double-spaced (about 3,000 words).: At the middle

Final Paper (1/3)** : Write a paper on an issue related to this course. The
form and topic of this paper is open; the only requirement is that you get
approval from your instructor. You might want to use this paper to analyze
some data, explore an issue through library research, write a review essay
comparing several books in a field, reflect critically on your own
professional practice in light of a body of literature (or vice versa), or put
together what you know about a particular issue based on course readings, to
name just a few examples. A one-page proposal for this paper is due on _March
16_. The paper itself is due no later than _April 27_. If you turn in a draft
by _April 6_ , you will be permitted to revise the paper (after receiving your
instructor's comments) and submit it for re-evaluation. Required (minimum)
length: 12 pages double-spaced (about 3,000 words).: Write a paper on an issue

Except in the case of a medical emergency, no incomplete or deferred grades
will be given in this course.

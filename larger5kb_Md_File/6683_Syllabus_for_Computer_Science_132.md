#### Overview

This course introduces concepts and practices skills necessary for further
study in computer science. Core concepts include object-oriented programming,
algorithm performance, arrays, recursion, and graphical interfaces. Students
will practice the skills of a computer scientist, which include testing and
debugging, technical writing, creating and verifying theories, and using
reference materials. While the course introduces its concepts assuming no
specific prior knowledge, it is expected that students have a general
understanding of computer programming (e.g. CS 131, programming instruction in
high school) or a demonstrated aptitude for problem solving.

The course will be taught using the Java programming language. Java is an
excellent language for learning objected-oriented concepts and offers a
standard programming interface for easily creating interactive software. We
will be running Java on the Solaris operating system (a variant of Unix),
which is installed on the lab PC's.

#### Grade Determination

Lab assignments will be handed out by the Monday of the scheduled lab period,
and will be due on the Monday following the lab (at the beginning of class).
Late assignments will be accepted until the following Friday with a 20%
penalty. The scheduled lab period will be used to discuss the assignment and
related concepts, and to provide students with immediate feedback as they work
on the assignment. While students should be able to complete a substantial
portion of the lab within the scheduled lab period, it is expected that a
significant amount of work must occur outside of class time in order to finish
the lab. Note: attendance at labs is mandatory.

In addition to two 50-minute tests and a cumulative final exam, quizzes and
excercises will be given on a nearly daily basis. These short quizzes, which
may or may not be graded on any given day, will serve as study guides for the
student and provide instant feedback for the instructor. Grades will be
determined as follows:

15% | Test 1 | Fri Feb 26  
---|---|---  
15% | Test 2 | Fri Apr 9  
25% | Final Exam | Mon May 10  
35% | 13 Labs | Weekly  
10% | Quizzes | Daily to Weekly  
  
#### Policy On Collaboration

Unless explicitly told otherwise, all assignments in this course are
individual assignments. Students may not work together in the design or
implementation of code or written assignments. The only exceptions to this
are:

  1. Students are encouraged to discuss course concepts and examples that are not specific to any assignment. 
  2. Students may assist each other in locating and diagnosing bugs in programs. 

All other assistance should come from the instructor or official TA. Any
questions about the appropriateness of collaboration should be discussed with
the instructor. Failure to acknowledge someone else's code or even design
ideas in any work is plagiarism, which warrants a report to the College's
judicial system and may lead to suspension or expulsion.

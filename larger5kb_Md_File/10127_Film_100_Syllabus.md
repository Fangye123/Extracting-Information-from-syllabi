Week Sixteen:  
Discussion and Review

Final: **Film Critique Due**

This course will introduce you to the basics of cinema as art and technology.
Elements of scene/film structure, style, and genre will be explored.   Film
history, which is vital to the understanding of sociopoliotical analysis and
film style will be given a brief overview, as will film narrative (continued
in FILM 200: Film Narrative, Spring '99).  You will participate in a scene
study workshop and ultimately offer your own systematic critique of a film of
your choice as final project.   There will also be an essay midterm and a
written report, TBA, based on discussion and the readings.

Cinema is an activist medium and one which a large group reception is an
important comment on the film itself.  Participation in class discussion and
screening attendance is therefore a requirement of this course.  I have
attempted to include films that will demonstrate not only the specific lecture
topic but also the readings, which may deal with a completely different
aspect.  In this way, you will better experience the many channels of film
information and the multifaceted analysis of a particular film.

*NOTE: All films scheduled are subject to availability and may be substituted. A mild "R" rating will apply to three of the films shown and will feature "adult language and themes."

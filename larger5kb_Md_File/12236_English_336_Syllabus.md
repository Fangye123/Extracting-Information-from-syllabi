**Attendance and Participation:**  
Your participation grade depends on your participation in discussions and on
your attendance in class. You are allowed **three** excused absences for
emergencies and illness. Beyond this limit, each absence will reduce your
participation grade by five points. You are expected to be on time for each
class. Changes in the syllabus and announcements for the class will be given
at the beginning of class. It is your responsibility to ensure that you know
about all changes on the syllabus.

**Research Paper:  
** You will need to select a topic for this paper and get it approved. The
final paper should be 5 to 7 pages in length, double-spaced, typed. The
research paper will be explained in more detail during the course of the class
(including a list of possible topics for the paper) and may include doing
original research.  
  
**Late Assignments:**  
Two points will be deducted from assignments for every day that they are late.
If your paper or assignment is going to be late, you need to inform me before
the assignment is due.  
  
**Short Assignments:**  
You will be given four short assignments, which will be take-home assignments,
to be due as announced.  
  
**Examinations:**  
The two examinations will be in class and the final will be take home. The
first two exams will be very similar to the homework given in class, so please
take these assignments very seriously.  
  
**Preventing Sexual Harassment**  
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination
against any participant in an educational program or activity that receives
federal funds. The act is intended to eliminate sex discrimination in
education. Title IX covers discrimination in programs, admissions, activities,
and student-to-student sexual harassment. BYU's policy against sexual
harassment extends not only to employees of the university but to students as
well. If you encounter unlawful sexual harassment or gender based
discrimination, please talk to your professor; contact the Equal Employment
Office at 378-5895 or 367-5689 (24-hours); or contact the Honor Code Office at
378-2847.  
  
**Students With Disabilities**  
Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning
atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities.
If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this
course successfully, please contact the Services for Students with
Disabilities Office (378-2767). Reasonable academic accommodations are
reviewed for all students who have qualified documented disabilities. Services
are coordinated with the student and instructor by the SSD Office. If you need
assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on
the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance
policy and procedures. You should contact the Equal Employment Office at
378-5895, D-282 ASB.

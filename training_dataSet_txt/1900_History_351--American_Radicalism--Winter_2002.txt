    A web version of this syllabus will be at http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/351syl--winter02.htm
  (last update 03/13/02). 
Check the web version regularly.  It will have links to class session
outlines, illustrations, useful websites, study questions, etc.  Also, there is a
"Blackboard" course site for History 351.  Log on at http://blackboard.uoregon.edu  You can use
it to link to this syllabus, and it will also contain course announcements and questions
for on-line discussion.  

    History 351 is the second term of a two-term sequence
on the history of American radical movement and ideas. This term we will deal with topics
in American radicalism since about 1900. History 350  is not a prerequisite.
    I do not assume that students in this class have any
previous course work in American history. If at some point you find yourself unfamiliar
with terminology, events, people, etc. mentioned in class or in the reading, don't
hesitate to check with me. I should be able to explain it to you or refer you to some
brief background reading.
    Discussion of the topics we cover this term is an
important part of the course. The political, social and ethical implications of the
material will, I hope, be of personal as well as intellectual interest to you. Because the
class is likely to be large, I shall be lecturing a good deal of the time, but I encourage
you to ask questions and make comments. Discussion will be most fruitful for all if people
keep up with the reading assignments as much as possible. 

BOOKS
    You should acquire the following books. They have been ordered at the
University Bookstore, and used copies of some are probably available at Smith Family. I
will also try to have copies on reserve in the library.

Emma Goldman          Anarchism
and Other Essays

John Steinbeck           In
Dubious Battle

Alexander Bloom        Long Time
Gone: Sixties America Then and Now

Barbara Epstein         
Political Protest and Cultural Revolution

Daniel Pope, ed.         American
Radicalism  (This book is rather expensive, and we will only use about half of
it this term; used copies may be available and I'm putting three copies of it on reserve
in Knight Library.)
At the bookstore, there will also be some copies of the following books:
Howard Zinn, The Twentieth Century: A People=s History and Candace Falk, Love, Anarchy and Emma Goldman. 
Don't buy either of these right now. They are intended for various paper topic options,
which will be described on a separate handout, coming soon.
There will be a few reading assignments on electronic reserve on the
web. 
To use electronic reserves for this course, click here.  Then search
(by Course) for Hist 351.  Then click where it says "Click Here for
Readings." You'll need to enter a User ID and Password: For this term, enter:

rain for the password
Then click on the item you want to read. It is in pdf format, which means you need Adobe
Acrobat Reader, but almost all computers will have it already.

        We will talk about defining
"radicalism" and about differences between twentieth-century radical movements
and earlier ones. We will also pose some of the questions that we will try to respond to
during the term: Has American affluence been a barrier to radical success? What is the
relationship between reform and radical change? What kinds of organizational forms work
best for movements for social change? What is the relationship between political and
cultural change? What roles have racism and sexism played in the modern history of
American radicalism?
Jan. 10-24: The Radical Left in the Early Twentieth Century-- Socialism,
Militant Labor, Anarchism and Feminism

        A complex of radical movements flourished in
the years before World War I. Although we will focus on the life and ideas of Emma
Goldman, America's leading advocate of anarchism, we will also consider the most dramatic
example of radicalism within the labor movement, the Industrial Workers of the World, and
the Socialist Party of America, which reached its height of political influence in these
years. In particular, Goldman=s life provides an
opportunity to discuss the relationship between personal life and social change.

        If, as many have claimed, prosperity has doomed
radicalism in the United States, why wasn't there a revolution in the Great Depression of
the 1930s, when the economy was in shambles for a decade? What did radical
movements accomplish in the 1930s? Is it possible that their strategies ultimately
strengthened the system they were trying to overthrow? Reading John Steinbeck=s vivid novel In Dubious Battle will allow us
to discuss both the effectiveness and the morality of left-wing strategies and tactics.

        The eruption of protest in the 1960s was one of
the more remarkable surprises in American history. In the movement for African American
freedom, in opposition to the war in Vietnam and in a host of other struggles, a "New
Left" made its mark. But the decade was also notable for a proliferation of radical
social movements--struggles of peoples of color, of women, of gay men and lesbians, and
many others intersected, often uneasily, with the predominantly white, college-based New
Left.

        Despite claims that radicalism is dead, social
movements at the end of the twentieth century have posed important challenges to the
status quo. Epstein's book is a study of non-violent direct action movements by someone
who played an active role in them.  Gamson is another scholar-activist who looks at
some of the internal tensions and paradoxes in the militant AIDS protest group,
ACT-UP.  We'll examine theories about the kinds of "New Social Movements"
and "Identity Politics" that seem to thrive when class conflict is hard to
detect and the Marxist left is very weak.

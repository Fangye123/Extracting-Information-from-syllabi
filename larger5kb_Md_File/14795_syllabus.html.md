Lectures will follow the text closely _but not exclusively_. In addition, this
course, of necessity, covers an immense amount of information in the
approximately 15 weeks that make up this semester. Therefore, **_regular class
attendance is necessary to pass the course_**. Attendance will normally be
taken at the beginning of each class period. College and district policy
states that you may be withdrawn from the course if you miss more than three
classes. If you simply stop attending class without officially withdrawing
from the course, you may be subject to receiving a failing grade for the
course (an "F").

Many students take geography courses expecting them to be easy. There is more
to geography than memorizing states, countries and capitals as you will find
out if you stay in this course for the duration.

As with any field of study, vocabulary is important and will be stressed.
Images/videos/slides, when shown, are intended as supplemental ("test-able")
information; hence, **TAKE NOTES!**

* * *

  


__GRADES:__ will be based on the following:  
(extra credit is not normally provided)  
  Maps/Assignments  | 8 x 10 pts each  | = 80  
---|---|---  
Media "clips"  | 6 x 5 pts each  | = 30  
Internet Reconnaissance  | 1 x 10 pts each  | = 10  
****CIA Reports** | **2 x 50** | **= 100**  
_Quizzes  _ | _6 x 50 pts each  _ | _= 300_  
  | **TOTAL:  ** | **  520 points**  
  
****   These assignments are to be completed in conjunction with ENG 102
standards and requirements.  See below for details.**  


_GENERALIZED GRADING SCALE:_ Although minor variations may occur, **DO NOT**
expect any exceptions! (e.g. an 89 is not an "A") Attendance and past
performance on quizzes/exams may be used as criteria when assigning final
course grade. The scale:  
  _90-100 = **A**_ | _80-89 = **B**_ | _70-79 = **C**_ | _60-69 = **D**_ |
_less than 60 = **F**_  
---|---|---|---|---  
  
Please, if you find yourself struggling, do not wait until the last week or
two of the semester to seek assistance; if you do, I cannot accommodate you!
See me early; this gives me the chance to offer you meaningful help.

ASSIGNMENTS  
**_(Always write your name on everything that you will hand in, in ink,
immediately after receiving it -- no name, no credit!)_**  


> 1\. Maps/Assignments:  maps and assignments are usually due on the day of
the exam to which that map/assignment pertains; handing in maps/assignments
early is strongly encouraged.  Also, neatness is part of the grade on these
assignments.  Using colored pencils is strongly encouraged; using ink is
strongly discouraged since it cannot be erased.  Please take a little pride in
your work.

>

> 2\. Media Clips:  you will be required to turn in six pieces of information
(such as newspaper articles) gleaned from your choice of media.  You must hand
in one "article" which deals with any aspect of each of the following regions
(one per region): Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Russia,
and Europe.  If you turn in an article from a newspaper, magazine, etc., you
need only to cut out (if it is your paper or magazine) or photocopy the
article, staple it onto a sheet of notebook paper, and hand it in.  If it is
from an electronic source, just print it and hand it in.  Please include the
date and source (name of paper/magazine) of the article.  I expect you to read
the article before handing it in.  Please make sure you have included the
entire article and not only the "front page" part of it.  (If it says "See
'China' on A-10" and you have not included the remainder of the article from
A-10, you get 1/2 credit.)  One paragraph articles are permitted; blurbs (one
or two sentence "ticklers") are not.  If you view something on TV, or hear
something on the radio, you must write a brief (one paragraph) summary of what
was communicated, and hand it in -- please include the date and the source
(station/program) of the story.  This is not intended to be a writing
assignment, so be brief and to the point.

3\. Internet Reconnaissance:  for this assignment you will be required to
access the Internet via the college library, Microcomputer Commons networks,
or your own personal Internet service provider.  You will be required to find
information off of the Internet about a country of your choosing (with certain
limits to be set forth on the assignment sheet).  Be sure to read all the
instructions on the assignment sheet.  This assignment is an information
gathering, and Internet practice, exercise designed to generate information
that can be used on the CIA Report (below).

4\. CIA Report:  This is a formal term paper assignment.  In general you will
be writing about certain aspects of a given country from a region we will be
covering this semester.  The information for this assignment will come, at
least in part, from Internet sources.  It is anticipated that much of this
information will have been gathered as part of the Internet Reconnaissance
assignment described above.  The grade will be based on content, grammar, and
completeness in following all instructions.  The grammatical part of this
assignment will be accomplished in coordination with the ENG 102 course in
which you are co-enrolled.  Additional details will be provided on the
assignment sheet given out later this semester.  


QUIZZES/EXAMS

> 1\. Exams may be made up of a variety of formats (including true/false,
fill-in-the-blank, short answer, and others), but are dominantly multiple
choice.

2\. Exams will require the use of SCANTRON sheets which YOU MUST PURCHASE from
the bookstore (form #19641).  No scantron, no exam, no exceptions.

3\. Every exam will have a map section.  A map will be provided, and you will
need to be able to both identify the feature that I have marked on the map and
to locate and label the items named.  All of these locations/features are from
the map assignment (discussed above).

4\. I reserve the right to make any quiz comprehensive, including the final.  


ATTENDANCE

> 1\. Attendance will be recorded EVERY day, and may impact your final course
grade.

>

> 2\. Hospitalization, major family disasters and official college/district
excuses (with the appropriate paper work) are generally the only acceptable
excuses for not completing assignments, or taking exams on their specified due
dates.  You are strongly encouraged to complete your assignments early!
Arrangements for any exceptions must be made in advance (I have email and
phone mail!).  I will be the judge of the validity of all excuses.    Please
do not make travel plans/reservations for any date/time earlier than the
date/time of the final exam!

>

> 3\. Please drop this class if you have a work schedule that will require you
to arrive late or leave early from class regularly.  It is not fair to your
fellow students, and it is rude to whomever is speaking or presenting at the
time.  If you come to class late, it is YOUR responsibility to notify me, at
the end of class, that you are present and to be sure that I update the roll.

>

> 4\. If, for a bonafide medical reason, you are unable to sit through an
entire class period, 1) talk to me about it, and 2) plan to sit in the back by
the door.

  
GENERAL POLICIES

> 1\. Any assignment turned in late or exam taken late will be subject to a
10% penalty (unless by PRIOR arrangements made with me you are forced to be
late).  Any assignment or exam that is more than one week past the due date
will be penalized 20%.  NO ASSIGNMENTS OR EXAMS WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER THE
LAST DAY OF CLASS, FRIDAY MAY 11, 2001 (not finals week), REGARDLESS OF
REASON.  The final exam MUST be taken on its scheduled day; no late finals
will be permitted.

2\. Extra credit is generally not offered nor available.

3\. Cheating will not be tolerated!  On the first offense, you will be given a
zero on that assignment/exam.  If there is a second offense, you will be
dropped from the course, with a failing grade, and referred to the campus
Academic Standards Committee for possible dismissal from the college.  (Using
assignments and/or exams and/or quizzes from previous semesters is cheating!)

4\. Pagers, cellular phones, and any other "communications devices" are
welcome in my classrooms.... ONLY IF OPERATED IN SILENT MODE (or, preferably,
switched off)!!  Please be considerate of others.  


HELP

1\. Paradise Valley Community College provides academic assistance in the
Learning Support Center (LSC) located in the E building. This includes
tutoring and study groups.  
    
2\. PVCC also provides free counseling services related to both academics and
personal problems. They are very good at what they do; use them if you find
yourself starting to "stress out". They are located in the Student Union
building (B-bldg) across from Admissions and Records.

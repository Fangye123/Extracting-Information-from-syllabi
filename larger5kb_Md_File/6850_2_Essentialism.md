In re Oluloro, No. A72 147 491 (Wash. EOIR Immigr. Ct. Mar. 23, 1994)
(unpublished transcript of oral decision, on file with the St. Mary's Law
Journal). "On March 23, 1994, in In re Oluloro, Immigration Judge Kendall
Warren handed down a decision which indicates that, in immigration
proceedings, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
should consider human rights abuses directed at women. The overriding concern
in the case confronting Judge Warren was the possibility that two  young U.S.
girls would suffer female genital mutilation (FGM) if the INS deported their
mother to Nigeria. In reaching the decision to suspend the mother's
deportation, Judge Warren condemned FGM as "cruel and serv[ing] no known
medical purpose."  Thus, Judge Warren ruled that the practice presented an
extreme hardship for the girls. Unfortunately, the court's ruling has no
precedential value because the INS chose not to appeal the decision to the
Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)." Patricia Dysart Rudloff, In Re Oluloro:
Risk of Female Genital Mutilation as "Extreme Hardship" in Immigration
Proceedings, 26 St. Mary's L.J.  877,  877-878  (1995).  
THE FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION ACT OF 1993, H.R. 3247

(a) IN GENERAL. -- Chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by
adding at the end the  
following new section:  
"s 116. Female genital mutilation  
"(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever knowingly circumcises,
excises, or infibulates the  
whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another
person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or  
both.  
"(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this section if the operation
is --  
"(1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is performed, and is
performed by a person  
licensed in the place of its performance as a medical practitioner; or  
"(2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given birth and is
performed for medical purposes  
connected with that labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is
performed as a medical  
practitioner, midwife, or person in training to become such a practitioner or
midwife.  
"(c) In applying subsection (b) (1), no account shall be taken of the effect
on the person on whom the  
operation is to be performed of any belief on the part of that or any other
person that the operation is  
required as a matter of custom or ritual.  
"(d) Whoever knowingly denies to any person medical care or services or
otherwise discriminates  
against any person in the provision of medical care or services, because --  
"(1) that person has undergone female circumcision, excision, or infibulation;
or  
"(2) that person has requested that female circumcision, excision, or
infibulation be performed on any  
person;  
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or
both."  
(b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT. -- The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 7
of title 18, United  
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new item:  
"116\. Female genital mutilation. . ."  
Elmer R. Rusco, Civil Liberties  Guarantees under Tribal Law: a  Survey of
Civil Rights Provisions in  Tribal Constitutions , 14 Am. Indian L. Rev. 269,
284-285 (1990)

"Four tribal constitutions discriminate by gender in establishing membership
in the tribe. The constitution of the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians
provides that:  [i]f a female member marries a non-Indian, she will
automatically lose her membership and will be required to leave the Community
within ninety days after written notice has been served upon her by the
Business Committee; Provided, That this provision shall not apply in the case
of any marriages consummated prior to the approval of this Constitution and
By-Laws. The governing document of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona provides that
members shall be those on a tribal roll taken in 1937, those born of mothers
and fathers who were on this roll, and "[a]ll children born after December 31,
1937, whose mother is a member of the Hopi Tribe, and whose father is a member
of some other tribe."'  The constitution of the Kiahlagee Tribal Town provides
that "[a]ll adult offspring of a marriage between a male member of the
Kiahlagee Tribal Town or Tribe may become members of the Town by applying for
admission, when accepted and approved by a majority vote of the members
present at any regular Kiahlagee Tribal Town membership meeting."'  One of the
categories of possible membership in Laguna Pueblo, as stated in its
constitution, is, "All persons of one-half or more Laguna Indian blood born
after approval of this revised Constitution (1) whose mother is a member of
the Pueblo of Laguna; or (2) whose father is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna,
provided the child is born in wedlock."'  Two constitutions discriminate by
gender in setting minimum  ages for voting in tribal elections. The Crow
Tribe's constitution states that "[a]ny duly enrolled  
member of the Crow Tribe, except as herein provided, shall be entitled to
engage in the deliberations  
and voting of the council, provided the females are 18 years old and the males
21 years."'  A resolution of the Quapaw Tribe adopted in 1956, which functions
as its constitution, states that  it is the desire of the individual male
members, 21 years of age and over, and female members, 18 years of age and
over, to establish a responsible administrative body to represent, speak and
act for the individual members of the Quapaw Tribe on matters affecting the
properties and general business of the Tribe. Presumably this language
specifies the voting rules for the Tribe."

## Course Organization:

One meeting per week (Tuesday, 3:30 - 5:00), three Saturday field trips.

## Course Objectives and Philosophy:

Most university classes are designed to transmit a block of information and to
assess how much of it students picked up. The colloquium for Earth, Life, and
Time is meant to be different. Here, our goals are:

  * To provide an opportunity for you to integrate the information you are receiving in other courses,  

  * To give you a direct window into the way natural scientists think and reinforce natural science topics that are especially important to them.

  * To give you the chance to develop communications, research, and presentation skills that will stand you in good stead later on.

In semester 1 we concentrate on developing basic knowledge of the big issues
in Earth and Life Sciences and on familiarizing you with basic digital
technologies.

  * **Colloquium presentations:** Colloquium sessions will be devoted either to presentations by the instructors or guest lecturers, or to work on semester assignments. Some sessions will feature a visiting lecturer. Visitors may be from other UMD departments, or may be from other institutions. 

  * **Group activity committees:** In the first colloquium session, students choose from a range of committees to get involved in. These committees are intended to become ongoing ELT institutions, so the work you do on them will provide the basis for later work by future classes. Further information on committees is available on our web site.

## **POLICY ON GRADES:**

There are three components, each of which contributes a third of your grade:
attendance, meeting participation, and committee participation.

  1. **Attendance:** (25%) Participation in colloquium meetings and field trips is mandatory, and attendance will be taken. A default grade of A will be given for attendance. Each student may have one unexcused absence from a class or field trip without penalty. After that, their attendance grade will be lowered by one letter grade with each additional unexcused absence. **PLEASE NOTE:**  

    * Students observed leaving the colloquium before 4:50 or before it is formally dismissed will be counted absent.   

    * If you have a legitimate reason for being absent, such as a family emergency or unavoidable academic conflict, we will excuse your absence, however you must notify us in a timely fashion. Requests for the excusing of an absence will not be considered after two days from the absence.   

    * We expect students to adhere to proper academic decorum during colloquia. This means focusing your attention on presentations, refraining from conversations or activities that are not relevant (e.g. reading newspapers, textbooks, etc.), and showing proper respect for student, faculty, and guest presenters. **We reserve the right to count you absent from colloquium if you fail to uphold this standard.**   

    * You may not realize it, but we have to pay money for you to go on field trips. If you tell us you are going to go on a field trip, **even an optional one** , and then fail to show, this will be counted as an unexcused absence.

  2. **Lecture-discussion participation:** (25%) Each class session will be divided into two parts, a 50 min. lecture/discussion session in which topics and readings in natural sciences will be introduced and discussed, and a 30 min. work session in which student groups will work on group committees (with a 10 min. break). Student grades for the meetings will be based on contribution to discussions. Students are expected to have read the week's assignments and to be prepared to discuss them. Grades of A, B, or C will be assigned based on the instructors' impressions of student preparation and participation. 

  3. **Committee participation:** (25%) Students will be assigned to one of several groups, each of which will be responsible for an ongoing colloquium topic (e.g. web site development, collections and display management for the ELT Museum). Each group will make a brief presentation of summarizing its activities at the end of the semester. We will ask each individual to submit a short paragraph detailing their personal contribution to the committee.

  4. **Quizzes:** (25%) To verify that you are, in fact, mastering the material we present, four quizzes will be administered during the semester. We will automatically drop the lowest of the four grades.

## **COMMUNICATION:**

Because many of our communications will be by e-mail, and several assignments
involve the Worldwide Web, all students are expected to maintain e-mail
accounts and arrange for access to the internet. Although not a course
requirement per se, students should get into the habit of checking their
e-mail daily. Failure to do so may cause you to miss crucial course
information.

## **DISHONESTY:**

Although you are encouraged to discuss assignments with your colleagues and
work together, work submitted under your name must be exclusively your own.
Evidence of dishonesty, cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic
dishonesty, or plagiarism on even one assignment will be forwarded to the
Honor Council for review. (See pp. 44-47 of UMCP 1999-2000 Undergraduate
Catalog.) Have a nice day.

## **EARTH, LIFE, AND TIME FRESHMAN COMMITTEES:**

This semester, we are founding a new institution, the Earth, Life, and Time
Museum (ELTM). This will be our own teaching collection of natural specimens,
including rocks, fossils, osteological specimens, etc. Several of this
semester's freshman committees will be devoted to developing and managing this
collection.

  * **ELT Museum: Collections managers:** This committee will be responsible for maintaining the physical inventory of specimens, accessioning new specimens, and designing and maintaining a specimen data base.

  * **ELT Museum: Exhibit design:** We will be taking over the display case in the north end of the Centreville lobby near the mail boxes. This committee will select attractive specimens from the ELTM collection and design and assemble an educational display out of them.

  * **ELT webmasters: Front end redesign:** Last year when we first taught ourselves html and designed the interface for the ELT web site, we thought we were pretty clever. Now, however, we can see that the site is a little amateurish. Help us look good by redesigning the interface and giving it a fully professional look.

  * **ELT webmasters: ELT Museum interface:** The ELTM will be more useful if its potential users can find out what's in it without having to come all the way to Centreville. Design and build a professional looking web interface that will allow visitors to see what's in the collection and learn our policy on its use.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 1:** Compile a complete and thorough set of lecture notes in outline format for "The Scientific Method I: Falsifiable Hypotheses." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 2:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "The Scientific Method II: The Scientific Tool Kit." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 3:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "The Discovery of Earth History." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 4:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "Measuring Geological Time." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 5:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "The Meaning of Fossils." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 6:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "The Discovery of Evolution." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 7:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "Evolutionary Processes." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 8:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "Evolutionary Patterns I: Describing the History of Life." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **ELT web authors: lecture 9:** Compile a complete set of lecture notes in outline format for "Evolutionary Patterns II: Recovering the History of Life." Write these up as an html file for the ELT web page.

  * **Social event/guest speaker coordinators:** Prepare at least three social events such as movie nights, pizza parties, etc. (Limited funding is available through Earth, Life and Time.) These activities must meet the following requirements:

    * They must be scheduled so that the maximum possible number of ELT students can attend.

    * Their themes must relate in some way to historical natural sciences. (For instance, a movie night during which we watch "Volcano" might be preferable to one in which we watch "Air Force One."

    * They must be events that the faculty directors can attend without anyone being embarrassed.

    * At least one of them must be an informal reception for our guest speakers.

_**  
Overall Goal for the Course**_ **:** To consider  "best practices" in reading,
writing, and assessment from various theoretical frameworks for the purpose of
challenging/interrupting/opening/ questioning/expanding... contemporary
literacy theories and practices.

  1. To expand and strengthen our theoretical frameworks from which we might consider contemporary literacy learning theories and pedagogy. 
  2. To further each of our own research/dissertation/contemplation agendas. 
  3. To help each other think, question, and write. 
  4. Of theoretical work (e.g., Foucault, Derrida, Rose, Latour, Bourdieu, Stone...) To always be thinking: What is he or she saying and how can I use it to rethink a contemporary literacy practice? 
  5. Of current reading, writing, and assessment practices (e.g., Clay, Pinnell & Fountas, National Research Council...) To always be thinking: What are the underlying assumptions of these contemporary theories and practices, what frameworks can shed light on those assumptions, and how do those assumptions play out in classrooms? 

If you are hoping to learn about what "best practices" in reading, writing,
and assessment "are," this might not be the right course for you. While we
will discuss and learn more about the kinds of instruction and programs being
advocated as "appropriate" or "best" in schools today, the purpose is to
contemplate (a nice word) these practices through various lines of thought.

**_Course Requirements_**

  1. Come to class each week having at least looked over the readings.

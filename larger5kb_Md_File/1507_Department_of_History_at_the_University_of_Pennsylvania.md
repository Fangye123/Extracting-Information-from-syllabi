Course Description

This seminar will examine the relationship between economic strength and state
power during the 19th and 20th century. In an age of intense economic and
political competition, how did shifts in economic and technological
capabilities impact the international balance of power? What is the
correlation between economic potency and the projection of military and
political power in the world? Is there a link between imperial overstretch and
economic decline? Some of the topics we will study include: the economic
factors behind imperialism; the relationship between economic competition and
the origins and outcomes of war; the impact of economic interdependence and
integration on power politics; a comparison of different economic systems and
their ability to translate economic strength into military power; an analysis
of economic reconstruction after both world wars; an examination of the
political and military impact of trade and monetary relations between nations.

Course Requirements

There will be two short papers (5 pages) and one longer, research oriented
paper (15 pages).

A large part of your grade will depend upon active and lively participation
during the seminar. The required reading must be completed before the assigned
class. Every week, one or two students will be responsible for presenting the
arguments from the readings in detail.

##  **Focus and Goals of the Course:**

As the course title suggests, there are many varieties of feminist theory.
This semester we will sample a selection of  primarily Western feminist social
and political thinkers from the 19th century to the present.  Some of the
questions we will ask include:

  * How have the 19th century legacies of Enlightenment, Marxist, and Freudian thought influenced the development of feminist theory?
  * Is it useful to make distinctions between the first and second wave theories? Between the second wave and an emergent third wave feminism?
  * As feminist theory in the academy becomes increasingly intellectually sophisticated and abstract, how can it remain useful in developing strategies for social change and providing insight into the daily life experience of diverse groups of women around the globe?
  * Are there too many varieties of feminist theory today?   Can theory help feminists of very different intellectual persuasions, not to mention differing  racial, ethnic, class, sexual,  national and religious identities find common ground for working together for change while recognizing and respecting their differences?

**Specific learning goals** are for students to become acquainted with a
variety of theorists; to become comfortable reading, discussing and critiquing
theoretical work; to acquire skills for analyzing theories; and to find ways
to apply the theories studied to current political conditions and life
situations.

* * *

##  **Course Requirements**

Class participation                      15%  
Short reaction papers                 15%    (do 8 out of 12  1-2 pp. papers)  
First paper (due March 12)        25%    8 typed double-spaced pages  
In-class exam  (April 2)              20%  
Final paper (due May 7)            25%    8 typed double-spaced pages  


**Class participation** :    (15 points)

  * **You must earn the grade.**
  * If you are not in class, you can't very well contribute, so poor attendance lowers your class participation grade.   I am most likely to take attendance at the beginning of the term to learn names, on small group discussion days, and if I notice dwindling numbers.
  * Participation is more than just showing up.  It is contributing to the class, responding to other students, helping to keep discussion on track, demonstrating that you have come to class prepared, and most important, learning to articulate ideas, finding a voice and listening.
  * For occasional small group discussions (listed on syllabus) each person will, at least once, serve as a facilitator, oral reporter, or written reporter (to be explained more in class), which counts toward participation.

**Reaction Papers**   (15 points)

  * These are short -- 1-2 pages, preferably typed, double-spaced.
  * There are 12 assigned;  only 8 required.
  * If you do more than 8, only the 8 highest grades will count.
  *  They will be graded "exceptional/excellent" (2 pts or A+.),  "good" (1.75 pts. or A-), partial credit (1.5 or 1 pt.) and 0 credit.
  * Most people will probably get "good" (1.75) most of the time; "excellent" (2.0) will be reserved for papers which demonstrate something extra special.
  * Late papers (on time for these means handed in during class) have a 50% grade penalty!
  * If you are not in class to discuss the paper the day it is due, you may lose part credit.
  * Please NO email or faxed papers -- they will NOT be accepted.

##  **First Paper  ** (25 points)  Due March 12

Select at least **three** theorists/readings from the list below (through
March 7 on the syllabus) and use their theories, highlighting similarities and
differences among the theorists, to analyze **one** of the following:

(a) A current (including re-runs) television show, film, or popular music
lyrics.  
(b) A current issue in the news;  
(c) Media coverage of a current issue (that is, focus on how the media
portrays the issue whereas b, above, is on the substance of the issue);  
(d) A current women's or gender issue on campus or in your life.

Theorists/readings: hooks ( _Feminism is for Everybody_ book), Wollstonecraft
(8), Taylor/Mill (12), Cooper (16), de Beauvoir (31), Radicalesbians (43),
Firestone (40), Hartman (63), Rubin (50), Combahee River Collective (54),
Lorde (57), Yamada (62), Chodorow (58), Gilligan (64), Kaplan (65), Rich (60),
MacKinnon (78), Daly (handout and/or Introduction to _Gyn/Ecology_ ). **You
must cover at least three from this list.**

  
Additional Guidelines for the First Paper:

  * Due March 12, but there is a no-penalty grace period until 5 pm March 13 as long as you attended class on March 12.  (In other words, don't skip class to finish the paper.)
  * Late papers received after March 13 are **penalized** as follows:  Mar. 14-16  "A" reduced to B+;  After Mar. 16, A reduced to B, etc.
  * Suggested length:  8 pages, must be typed and double-spaced
  * Please NO email or faxed papers -- they will NOT be accepted.

###  Grading considerations for both first and final papers:

  * Careful writing, proofreading, spell checking, etc. required.
  * Poor writing or poor organization will lead to a poor grade.
  * I will look for original, critical thinking, in depth analysis, demonstration of good grasp of the reading assignments discussed
  * Avoid unsupported generalizations, trite or superficial comments.
  * Full citation of **all** sources required, including course readings for this course
  * Your selection of   theorists and topic should fit well together to make a coherent paper.
  * If you don't follow instructions and your paper does not fit the specific requirements of this assignment, you will get a low or failing grade.
  * If you are not sure if your topic or choice of readings fit, be sure to consult with me ahead of time.
  * **The most important factor** **in the grade is how well you discuss the theorists and apply them to your topic.**
  * **Warning** , academic integrity means, among other things, that if the paper is not written in your own words you could be charged with plagiarism and receive an F.

#  **Final Paper**   (25 points)  Due May 7

**Read directions carefully !**

  * Use at least 4 theorists/readings (as listed below) we have read this semester to analyze and critique the representation in popular culture or any aspect of  the media of women from some "non-dominant" racial, ethnic, religious, class, sexual, or national group. ("Non-dominant" may mean non-white, non-Christian, non-heterosexual, poor, immigrant, foreign, poor/low-income, etc.).
  * At least 2 of your 4 theorists must be from assigned readings since the exam (after April 2 on the syllabus).
  * You may NOT use any of the same theorists/readings for the first and final papers unless they are extras, beyond your four main theorists, and you may not use the exact same topic (same film, TV show, etc.) as in the 1st paper.

Theorists/readings approved for the final paper:

  * **At least 2 from:**   Collins (82), Davis (83), Williams (87), Anzaldua (73), Gunn Allen (70), Plaskow (71), Narayan (prometheus), Mohanty (67), Mernissi (48), Delombard (86), Alfonso & Trigilio (prometheus), Siegel (prometheus)
  * The other 2 may be from the list above, from the list for the first paper, or from: Haraway (69), Harding (72), Keller (84), Stanworth (80), Butler (81), Fuss (76), Wittig (59), Irigaray (55)
  * But, not any of the same theorists or readings you used for the first paper

  
Additional guidelines for final paper:

  * Other examples of a "non dominant" group of women may be possible -- ask if you have questions
  * Many forms of popular culture and media are appropriate  \-- again, ask if you have questions
  * Suggested **length:   8 pages**; must be typed and double-spaced
  * Longer papers are permitted but 8 pages is fine;  quality is much more important than quantity
  * Late final papers will receive an incomplete only with advance written permission (new University contract form).
  * Late final papers will receive a penalty of one full letter grade (A becomes B etc.)
  * Late final papers without written permission and a contract for an incomplete will receive a zero.

##  **Academic Integrity and Plagiarism**

* Students are expected to adhere to the University Academic Integrity Code.
* Be careful to be sure to fully cite all sources.
* Ask for help and/or consult a style manual if you are not sure how, when, or   whether to include a citation.
* **All papers must be written in your own words**.
* Read online: What is [plagiarism](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/wts/plagiarism.html) and how to avoid it
* Papers that fail to address the specific topics and questions assigned for this class risk an F.

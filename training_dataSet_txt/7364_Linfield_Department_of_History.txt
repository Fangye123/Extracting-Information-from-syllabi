History 476: History of Soviet Russia




Course Description
A survey of the history of the Soviet Union, beginning 
        with the February 1917 Revolution and continuing up to the present. Major 
        emphasis is placed on the role of personalities and strong leadership 
        in the Soviet Union, along with changing gender roles, evolving political, 
        social, and economic issues, and the influence of artists and dissidents 
        on Russian society.
Course Materials
These include a basic textbook, three supplementary 
        texts, and a novel. Assignments for these are given below.

Dziewanowski, M.K. A HISTORY OF SOVIET RUSSIA.

This is the basic textbook for the class and readings 
            in it are distributed by chapter across the entire fourteen weeks.

Suny, Ronald, and Adams, Arthur. THE RUSSIAN 
          REVOLUTION AND BOLSHEVIK VICTORY. 
This is a collection of primary and secondary source 
            readings on the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. You should begin 
            reading it immediately and to research it for your first out-of-class 
            essay.

Medish, Vadim. THE SOVIET UNION. 
This is a description of the land, people, and party 
            of the Soviet Union, and it includes useful information on the institutions 
            of Soviet government and society. Readings begin the first week of 
            class and continue to ----, thence to resume on ---- and to continue 
            to the end of the course.

Adams, Arthur. STALIN AND HIS TIMES.

This book discusses the life of Stalin and his leadership 
            of the Soviet Union from 1928 to1953. It is to be used for background 
            and information and for the mid-term examination.

Koestler, Arthur. DARKNESS AT NOON.

This book was written by a man who converted to 
            communism in Germany during the troubled years of the Weimar Republic 
            and who spent a period of time in the Soviet Union after escaping 
            Nazi persecution in 1932. Koestler later became disillusioned with 
            communism and his fictional recreation of the purge trials of 1937 
            proved to be one of the most powerful critiques of Stalinism ever 
            produced. It is to be used in writing the second out-of-class essay, 
            due on ----.


Documentary films have been scheduled throughout 
            the course. Titles are listed below in the weekly calendar.


You are encouraged to read other works on the history 
            of the Soviet Union and to follow recent and contemporary developments

Preparation for the mid-term and final examinations 
      The mid-term and final examinations will consist of 
        a choice of two essay questions chosen from the questions that are discussed 
        in class on Friday of each week.
The first paragraph of each essay should respond directly 
        to the question you are addressing and should how you intend to answer 
        it.
You should then write on three or four important points 
        that will convince the reader that your interpretation of the circumstances 
        and events associated with your topic is valid.
Present factual information to validate your points 
        and place those facts in an appropriate time frame. Take care not to put 
        events in improper sequences and make sure that you have your facts straight.
Devote a paragraph to the negative side of your interpretation. 
        What major problems does your interpretation pose and how might they be 
        solved?
What conclusion can you draw from your appraisal of 
        the history that your are discussing? Take into account the circumstances 
        and events that you have discussed, offer an assessment of the problem 
        that the question poses, and give the reader some advice on what lessons 
        might be drawn from it.
Write legibly and try to eliminate spelling and grammatical 
        errors.

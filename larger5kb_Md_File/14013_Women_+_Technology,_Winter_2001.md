### course objectives:

Technology is neither good nor bad, but it is critically important to
investigate how technical power and knowledge operate in contemporary society.
Context is everything, so in this course we will examine the difficult
relationship between women and technology.

Why a difficult relationship? Perhaps because technical know-how as a form of
knowledge is so strongly male-identified, perhaps because in this era the
acquisition of (or claim to) expertise provides access to power and
accentuates the exclusion of women from power, perhaps because historically
women were to be "served" by technological gadgets, perhaps because the recent
emergence of formidable information technologies has sharply divided women
between enthusiasts and loathers--whatever the reason, we had better
investigate it.

In this course, we will examine centrally issues of technology, gender, power,
and politics. In one sense we will examine how society shapes technologies and
how technologies, once implanted, shape societies--that's fine, but we will
more concisely examine how technological artifacts have been used to engender
women in very specific ways, and how women have tried to reshape technologies
for their own uses. For example, as part of an examination of
technoenthusiastic rhetoric, we'll see how liberatory discourses were
developed in order to "free" women from the demands of hard, paid labor and,
in turn, to liberate them from "domestic servitude." From this, we will learn
that, as Marcuse argued, some liberatory impulses can often oppress further.

If knowledge is power, this course will empower--in part by examining paths of
disempowerment, in part by understanding the social dynamics of technology.

###  
assignments:

 Students will be expected to complete a research paper--thesis chapters are
acceptable--of about 20 pages on topics of their choice. Topics should first
be cleared with the professor, and we will spend some class time discussing
research approaches and proposals, which themselves will be required. Students
will also be expected to select a relevant book or article and write a 5 to
7-page critique of it and integrate their reactions to it into the research
paper. Some time will be spent in class on developing research (and
researchable) topics. Weighting of scores: research proposals, 20%; research
paper, 40%; recommended book critiques, 25%; class participation: 15%.

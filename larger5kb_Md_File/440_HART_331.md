_COURSE CONTENTS_ :

NOTE: Restricted admission, consent of instructor required.

The theory of the film director as auteur was developed in France in mid 1950s
by directors and critics who were instrumental in creating the French New Wave
cinema. Initially imported to the United States by the New York film critic
Andrew Sarris, the theory took deep roots here. According to this theory, the
film's author, as source and center of the film, is the director. Although
other key production figures are certainly important, the one person whose
vision and personality dominates all stages of film production is the
director. Much debate ensued on this topic following its introduction, a
debate that was superseded for a time by the emerging structuralist and
poststructuralist criticism that questioned authorship in favor of readership.
However, there is now a resurgence of new thinking about the meaning of film
authorship and this class is designed to provide you with an opportunity to
engage with this thinking by means of examining the works of three key
American film authors, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Arthur Penn, with
widely divergent authorial styles, who have come to the fore since the 1960s.
As a result, the 1960s forms the historical, sociopolitical, and cultural
contexts for this discussion of authorship and cinema.



_CLASS FORMAT_ :

This is a seminar course, each class session consists of a brief lecture,
film/video screenings, student presentations, and discussion. All the required
screenings will occur during the class sessions. However, occasionally you are
required to attend Rice Cinema and the Museum of Fine Arts' film screenings.
Admittance to Rice Cinema for students of this course is free of charge.

additional time and activity on your behalf. This component is intended to
help us explore the uses of the Internet and its resources in teaching and
learning media studies topics.

_ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADES_ :

Assignments for this course consist of oral presentations to the class,
computer activities, synopses of the readings, and two take-home term papers.

Oral presentations are to be based on the assigned materials (readings and
films). Topics will be assigned/chosen in the first class session. Before each
presentation, prepare a 3-4-page paper consisting of analysis and critique of
the topic. Distribute the paper to all class participants. Your presentation
may also include demonstration and/or screening of materials. You are
encouraged to do outside readings to bolster your presentations and to provide
additional information to the class. Oral presenters are expected to lead the
discussion that follows their presentation. For additional sources, consult
the instructor or the materials on reserve in Brown library.

The topic for the first term paper is assigned by the instructor. You can
choose your own topic for the final paper only in consultation with the
instructor.

At the beginning of each session, hand in a 1-2 page type-written summary of
that session's assigned readings that highlights the main points of each
reading.

The course grade will be based on the grades for term papers, oral
presentations, synopses of the readings, newsgroup participation, and your
attendance and participation in class discussions. All papers must be typed
double-space and include full bibliographic and filmographic citations (use
the MLA or the Chicago style).

The maximum length of the oral and written assignments, their due dates, and
grade value are noted in the chart below.

ASSIGNMENTS PAGES DUE DATE GRADE VALUE

Oral presentation 30 min. as scheduled 15% of class grade

Term paper 7-9 Week 7 (3/3) 30

Final paper 10-12 5/6, 5/12 40

Attendance/participation 10

All papers are due at the START of each class session. Failure to turn them in
at that time will result in lowering of the paper's grade.

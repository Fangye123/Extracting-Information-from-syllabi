Course Description:

The course assumes no prior knowledge of Arabic or the Arab world. It is a
survey of the twentieth century Arab world as presented by Arab writers of
fiction. The novels and short stories that form the basis of the syllabus deal
with major political, social, religious, and cultural aspects of modern Arab
society. The lectures will follow a general chronological path that provide
students with both a coherent historical context for the literary texts as
well as a schema for the major schools and trends of contemporary Arabic
fiction. The texts selected represent a wide geographical, ideological,
cultural and aesthetic (artistic) span. General themes, such as family,
religion, gender, childhood, education, poverty, war, emigration, and freedom
of expression, will be the focus of the course.

**Course Description**  
This seminar provides an introductory overview of racial and ethnic relations
in the United States. The immigration histories of various minority groups
will be discussed, along with their present-day status within the dominant
society. Examples of the types of topics to be discussed include affirmative
action, bilingual education, communication differences, immigration, language
rights, multicultural education, nativism, political involvement, and the
dynamics of prejudice.

**Course Requirements**  
Students are expected to attend all classes and complete all assigned
readings. Participation in discussions is strongly encouraged. Students are
responsible for obtaining lecture notes/handouts from fellow classmates in the
event of an absence. Absences due to scheduled university activities, health
problems, or serious family emergencies (such as the illness of a child or a
death in the family) will be excused IF they are documented with a note from
an appropriate professional (physician, funeral director, etc.). Students who
accumulate more than three (3) unexcused absences will be penalized.

Each student will be required to keep a journal in the form of private e-mail
messages addressed to the instructor (e-mail to
[dmanning2@unl.edu](mailto:dmanning2@unl.edu) \-- Note: subject line should
say **ES100** ). These "e-Journal" entries should each be 2-3 paragraphs long.
The first paragraph or two should summarize and discuss the day's reading
assignment(s). The final paragraph(s) should focus on your reactions to the
issues covered in class, the reading assignments, and day-to-day experiences
in your life that can be related to the minority experience. Special emphasis
will be given to issues that challenge our own cultural "blinders" and
reactions to/feedback on lectures/films, etc. E-Journal entries must be sent
by no later than midnight on the due date; I will send you a confirmation
message to verify receipt of your e-Journal entry. You should save a copy of
each of your e-Journals and your confirmation messages.

**Grading Policy**  
Exams will include numerous testing techniques, including multiple choice,
true/false, fill-in-the-blank, matching, short answer identification of terms,
and essays. Exams will cover the lectures, required readings, and films
covered in class. Exams and Journal Entries may NOT be made up unless the
student provides documentary evidence as described in the above section.
Projects turned in late without documentary evidence as described above will
be penalized by 1/3 letter grade for each 24 hours that they are late.

Final grades will be determined as follows:

I will not take attendance and there is no formal penalty for missing class

Please note, however, that 25% of your grade is based on assignments and
quizzes. Some of these quizzes or assignments will be **unannounced** and
**in-class**. Make-ups for these will be granted in only the most dire
circumstances. Further, past experience with teaching this class suggests that
a student's attendance is strongly related to exam performance.

All students are expected to take the exams on the scheduled date. If you have
a legitimate excuse, you must notify me **before the exam**. Anyone missing an

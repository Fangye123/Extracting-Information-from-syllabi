# Course Objectives

This course is designed to introduce the application of systematic
methodologies and tools to designing and improving business process enabled by
emerging information technologies. The focus of the course is on the basic
principles and methodology of business process analysis and design for
dramatic improvement. Information engineering methodology that enable
organizations to plan and integrate business strategies with information
systems through the development of an comprehensive enterprise models and
information infrastructures, will be introduced in this class. Joint
Application Design method which can be used to elicit business and information
requirements from users will be discussed. Methods such as structured
techniques, information engineering, object-oriented analysis and design will
be discussed. Tools that support these tools will be presented. The
organizational planning and strategies for implementing business process
improvement and information engineering in an organization will be discussed.

# Project and Presentation

Students teams are assigned business design or information development
projects. They work on real-world cases and interact with users to determine
the systems requirements and create business and information systems models of
the system. They will develop prototypes to demonstrate concepts of operations
of their systems.

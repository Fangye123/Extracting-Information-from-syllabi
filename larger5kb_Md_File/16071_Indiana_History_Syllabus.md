**HISTORY 415 / 515 / Section 002: THE HISTORY OF INDIANA**  
Fall Semester 2002  
Meets Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00-3:15 P.M., in BB 106  
---  
  
**_COURSE DESCRIPTION_**

Does Indiana possess a unique identity?  If so, what traits distinguish the
state from its neighbors in the Middle West, or for that matter, from the rest
of the nation?  We will consider these questions historically by examining the
peoples who have called this place home from ancient times to the present.
Additionally, we will use events and trends from Indiana history to understand
American history in all of its manifestations \-- social, political, cultural,
economic, religious, and military.

**_  POLICY ON ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION_**

Students are expected to attend all class meetings, exams, and the [Conner
Prairie](http://www.connerprairie.org) field trip, and to arrive punctually
and ready for listening and discussion.  This course will combine lectures
with discussion of the assigned readings.  The latter activity involves, in
Antonio Gramsci's words, "the detailed work of discussion and the
investigation of problems in which everybody participates, everybody
contributes, and in which everybody is simultaneously teacher and student."
To be successful the course thus requires the faithful attendance and regular
thoughtful contributions by all.

Five percent of your course grade depends on fulfilling this imperative.
Students are permitted two unexcused absences during the semester.  Missing
more than that will result in the lowering of your final grade.  Excused
absences as defined by the University include serious illness, a death in the
family, religious observance, and participation in varsity athletics.  Such
absences will only be considered excused when they are accompanied by
appropriate written documentation (e.g., physician's note in the case of a
serious illness), which must be turned in to the Instructor at the next class
meeting following the absence.)

In the event that you are absent, it is your responsibility to contact me or
one of your classmates to catch up on the work you have missed in class.  
    
    
  

**_  MAKE-UP EXAM POLICY_**

Make-up exams will be administered only in extraordinary cases of an emergency
nature.  You must make every effort to contact me prior to the exam to discuss
your circumstances.  Do not assume that you will be permitted to take a make-
up exam if you fail to show up for any regularly scheduled exam without prior
arrangement.  
    
    
  

**_  WRITING ASSIGNMENTS_**

There will be two short (5 pp.) papers due during the semester, with research
based at least in part on primary sources.  For these assignments each student
will write a historical account of an Indiana community and a biography of one
person who is significant to the state's history.  These may be selected from
a list or otherwise approved by the instructor.  There will also be a 3 pp.
paper resulting from our class field trip to Conner Prairie near Fishers,
Ind., on Sunday, 29 September.  Assignment Guidelines with detailed
information will follow.

All writing assignments must be neatly typed, double-spaced, and stapled.
Top, bottom, and side margins should be set at approximately one and one-
quarter inches.  Besides listing your name, the date, and the assignment
topic, your paper should be titled and paginated.  Citations must conform to
the [Chicago Manual of
Style](http://www.wisc.edu/writetest/Handbook/DocChicago.html).  Always
proofread and run the spelling-checker utility on your draft before printing
it out for submission.  Late papers will be penalized one-third letter grade
for each day past the deadline (e.g., a B- would be reduced to a C+ if one day
late).  
    
    
  

**_  READING ASSIGNMENTS AND QUIZZES_**

You should plan to read carefully all selections by the date they are
assigned, regularly consulting a dictionary for any terms that are unfamiliar.
Bring the books with you when you come to class and be prepared to discuss the
readings.  Fifteen (15%) percent of your grade for this course is determined
by pop quizzes that will be given from time to time during the semester.
They will be administered ONLY during the first fifteen minutes of class and
be based on that day's Reading Assignment Study Questions, which are posted on
the course webpage. You may consult any answers you have completed to these
study questions during the quizzes (although not during the exams).  There
will be no make-ups for absentees, nor extra time given to students who come
late to class.  Your lowest grade will be dropped.

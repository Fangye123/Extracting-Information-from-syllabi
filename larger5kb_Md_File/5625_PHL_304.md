**Course Description**

This course discusses contemporary moral issues in the context of ethics and
political philosophy. Often, when people disagree about an issue such as
abortion or welfare, they disagree not only about the facts but about basic
ethical issues. In this course we will ask some basic ethical questions,
investigate answers proposed by important moral and political philosophers,
and think about what those answers mean for contemporary public problems.

The course falls into four parts:

  1. **Liberty.**

What are the limits of liberty? Are there decisions you should be free to make
without outside interference? We will consider the views of Aristotle, Burke,
and Mill, applying them to the issue of drug legalization.

  2. **First Principles.**

Some philosophers think that the right thing to do is whatever is, in the long
run, for the best. How do we decide what is for the best? Is that always a
good moral guide? Other philosophers think that respecting others as ends-in-
themselves, equal to ourselves, is the key to moral thinking. Still others
stress virtues.  We will look at Aristotle, Kant, and Mill, testing their
views on issues of sexual behavior and the environment.

  3. **Rights and Responsibilities.**

What rights do you have? How do we decide? What does it mean to have a right?
We will turn to Burke, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Mill for answers, and
apply our insights to controversies over abortion and capital punishment.

  4. **Justice and Equality.**

What is justice? Is the current distribution of resources fair? Are there ways
of making it fairer? We will examine Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Camus,
Rawls, and Nozick for answers in theory, and consider issues of economic and
racial equality for answers in practice.

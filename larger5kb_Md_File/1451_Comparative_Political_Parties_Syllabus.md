## Comparative Political Parties

### Course Description:

This seminar will focus on the emergence, role, and influence of political
parties in advanced capitalist democracies. Political parties are one of the
central institutions of modern representative democracies. Parties recruit
candidates for public office, formulate programs for governmental action,
compete for votes, and if lucky, exercise executive power until ejected from
office. For Americans who are used to thinking of party competition as a
duopoly between Republicans and Democrats, one of the more interesting aspects
of comparative party politics is the complexity of multiparty competition.
Most of the course readings will focus on party politics in Europe, where
multiparty systems are the rule, not the exception.

### Requirements:

This is a seminar course, which means that students are expected to
participate actively through class presentations and discussion. This course
provides an opportunity to practice the essential skill of oral presentation
of ideas. The course will require a substantial amount of reading, which must
be completed prior to the class period so that you may participate actively
and intelligently.

There is also a substantial writing component for this course. Students will
write two short papers analyzing the readings assigned for two weeks of their
choosing. One of these summaries will be presented in class. There will also
be a research paper due at the end of the term. This research paper will be
presented to the class at the end of the semester. The final exam will be a
take home essay exam.

**Relative weights of course requirements:**

  * Participation 10% 
  * [Class Presentations](weeks.html) 10% 
  * [2 Weekly Summaries](weeks.html) 15% each 
  * [Research Paper](paper.html) 25% 
  * [Term Paper Presentation](finalpres.html) 10% 
  * Final Exam  25% 

### Readings:

Readings will be drawn from books and journal articles on reserve in the main
library, or for sale at the BU bookstore. Students would be wise to make
copies of the required reading over the course of the semester, as they will
be expected to discuss some of these readings on their final exam. Because
that exam will be an open book exam, students will probably want to refer to
the original works rather than relying entirely on memory.

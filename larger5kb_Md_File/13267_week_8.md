**Introduction** to  "Recovery of the Dao: The Way to Order in the Late
Empire."

In the final decades of the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) the imperial court
gradually diminished its patronage of Buddhist clergy, monasteries, and sacred
sites. As in Kamakura Japan, Buddhist beliefs and practices retained its broad
support on the local level. But the emperors of the Song dynasty (960-1279),
and of all subsequent dynasties, accorded foremost importance to Confucian
ritual, Confucian texts, and Confucian scholarship.

The growth of an empire-wide market economy and the concomitant improvements
in infrastructure (roads, waterways, ship-building, et cetera) resulted in
increasing urbanization, economic activity, and geographical and social
mobility, while the spread of printing (invented in the eighth century) and
the recruitment of government officials through a standardized examination
system required the standardization of the texts and interpretations of the
sacred Confucian canon. These circumstances, so different from those of the
Zhou dynasty, inspired renewed debates about the nature of the Dao and about
the relationship between the present and the past, between Song times and
legendary Antiquity.

Like the buildings in Tang depictions of Buddhist Pure Lands (paradises), the
model rises on terraces from a lotus pool. On each of the four sides, steps
and bridges, guarded by paired lions on columns, provide access across the
pool to the main terrace and the four locked doors. Standing in front of the
windows, two _lokapalas_ (Heavenly Kings) guard the main entrance. Slender
columns support the projecting eaves and tiled roof. The mast that crowns the
pagoda has six canopies ( _chattras_ ), a seventh of distinctive, umbrella-
like form, and, successively, a ring or halo, crescent moon and jewel, and a
lotus bud finial. In architectural form and detail, this is a work of the
early or High Tang dynasty, seventh to eighth century BCE, reflecting Pure
Land Buddhism, with no hint of any Esoteric elements. The motif of a crescent
moon and jewel, in particular, which ultimately derives from the crowns of
Sassanian kings, appears frequently in the headdresses of Early and High Tang
bodhisattvas in the cave-temples at Dunhuang. Nevertheless, the workmanship of
the small parcel-gilt silver coffin contained within the pagoda, which in turn
held a fingerbone relic, is similar to that of the many objects made much
later, around the time of the final dedication in 874.

Multiple containers made of valuable materials were invariably used to hold
relics (which could be just tiny, glassy grains). In the case of the Famen
Monastery, where the relic was held to be from the true body of Sakyamuni, the
historical Buddha, the containers had to be even more impressive. Placed
towards the rear of the innermost chamber, this is the second of a set of
eight nesting caskets. Only fragments remain of the outermost casket, which is
made of sandalwood carved with figures of devotees and figures from Buddhist
Pure Lands, including the Pure Land of the West of Buddha Amitabha--the Buddha
of Boundless Light and the focus of Pure Land worship. It was apparently
surrounded by a wooden railing with carved balusters topped by gilt lotus
buds, similar to the railing surrounding the gilt bronz _stupa.  
  
_ The second to the seventh caskets were lowered into each other by means of
lengths of silk, remnants of which remained in their original positions when
the objects were discovered. Each casket was fastened by a paddlock, with the
appropriate key still in place. All share the same square shape with chamfered
lid but are decorated in different ways. Each side of this, the second casket,
shows one of the Four Guardian Kings. The third casket is of plain silver.
Next are two caskets decorated with figural designs: the fourth with preaching
scenes of four Buddhas, each associated with one of the four directions; the
fifth illustrates Esoteric deities. The sixth and seventh caskets have no
figural designs, but are encrusted with pearls and semiprecious stones.
Finally, the eighth container, a mere two inches in height, is not a casket
but a tiny single-story pagoda fashioned out of solid gold; the relic
fingerbone rested on a silver post.  
  
**Questions**  
  
  1. How do Chinese and Korean Neo-Confucian authors view Buddhism? How do Chinese and korean Buddhist authors defend Buddhism against their criticism?  
  

  2. How do the authors represented in this week's readings understand "Chineseness"? How do they imagine "Chineseness" and how do they understand its transmission, its continuity? How do they understand the relationship between the present and the past?   
  

  3. What are the central concerns of Tang- and Song-dynasty "Neo-Confucianism"? How do these concerns differ from the preoccupations of Warring States and Han-dynasty "Confucianism"? Where lie the disagreements between Neo-Confucians themselves?

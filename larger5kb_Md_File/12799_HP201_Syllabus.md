### COURSE INFORMATION

**ASSIGNMENTS**. Students will be asked to prepare a written paper divided
into two parts, each part due separately. The paper will be based on a
selected topic that involves any feature of the cultural landscape, such as a
building, structure, site, or transportation corridor. The paper will combine
the use of periodical literature and trade journals with field study. A
description of the assignment will be provided. In final form, the two
segments should be typed, and each should be approximately one thousand (1000)
words long. A one-page outline of the topic and periodical literature
selected, time-spans included, will be due on January 29th. The first segment
will be due on February 28th; the second on April 23rd. Students are welcome
to submit drafts of their papers in advance of the deadlines.

**ATTENDANCE**. Class attendance is required, and the instructor must be
notified regarding any absences (See grading below)

**BIBLIOGRAPHY**. A bibliography of readings for further study on each of the
lecture topics will also be posted on the instructor's web page. This list
should be considered as a beginning point for research concerning the topics
identified and should be consulted during selection and preparation of the
written assignment.

**EXAMINATIONS & GRADING**. Preliminary and final examinations will be based
on assigned readings, class presentations, and discussion. The preliminary
exam will be given on March 7th. The course grade will be determined as
follows: preliminary, 20%, final exam 30%, paper, 30%, attendance and class
participation, 20%.

**FIELD TRIP**. A field trip may be scheduled depending on interest and
availabletime.

**IMPORTANT PLACES, DATES, AND PERSONS**. Each student will receive a list of
important places, dates, persons, etc., mentioned in the lectures. These are
arranged by lecture topic and provide a skeleton outline of the course.
Students should review these lists before class.

**OFFICE HOURS**. Office hours will be announced and a list of available half-
hour segments will be posted at Wheeler House. Students should reserve
available periods. If you believe your questions will require more than thirty
minutes, please feel free to reserve two segments. However, be aware that
other students also may be seeking available time.

**THEMATIC OVERVIEW**. The course seeks to provide students with a basic
understanding of the historical document that is our cultural environment,
whether built or natural. The subject is vastly complex, and the course is not
intended to provide a comprehensive study of any one aspect of the landscape.
In truth, any of the topics (and many of the sub-topics) appearing on the
syllabus could be developed into an entire course. Nevertheless, the syllabus
does provide a skeleton that suggests the essential reasons why our landscape
appears as it does. With fundamental understanding, students will be able to
read this historic document, to absorb some of the information that it holds,
and to explore other segments more deeply without losing sight of the basic
structure. Several themes will be traced throughout.  
1\. The discipline of historic preservation seeks to identify and preserve
those parts of our physical heritage that hold valuable information about our
culture. Evaluating historic significance \-- the process of selecting those
monuments worthy of preservation \-- is fundamental, and the course will probe
the means by which we make this assessment. In short, what are the economic,
social, technological, political, aesthetic, and intellectual contributions
that any given part of our physical heritage makes?  
2\. At the same time, we should all be able to recognize and understand the
picture puzzle that is our cultural landscape without resorting to structured
analysis of historic significance. Hopefully this will lead to a stronger
understanding of American culture and a deeper appreciation of all that
surrounds us.  
3\. Historic preservation's emphasis on the built environment has sometimes
resulted in neglect of the natural environment and its culturally assisted
evolution. The unfortunate result is that alliances with other disciplines
that pursue goals common to those of historic preservation have failed to
materialize. The course will make strong efforts to connect the two.  
4\. The study of methods for reading the landscape is as important as learning
about the history that exists if only we know where to look. The course will
seek to develop both goals.  
5\. The study of landscape history is one of examining overlapping layers on
the face of the land. Those layers can be confined to a small area and be
readily visible, for example a building with clearly defined alterations added
over the years. Alternatively, the layers can be complex and difficult to
separate, as in urban areas where human existence has forced sweeping change
over the centuries.



### WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS

The paper should be the product of combined periodical research and field
study and should involve a feature that is part of our cultural landscape.
Students may select a topic from any of the materials presented by this course
but should try to emphasize some feature or place of personal interest. For
example, those intrigued by railroads might identify a specific feature
commonly employed on railroad systems, e.g. a bridge or building type, signal,
etc. The following steps should be observed in completing this assignment:

**PART 1**.  
Select a topic by identifying a periodical or trade journal of personal
interest and scan the pages of each issue for a two-year period prior to 1910,
if possible. You may scan more than two years if you so desire (a five year
review works much better). For example, a scan of Nature, a monthly journal,
could involve review of twenty-four issues between 1910 and 1912. It is very
important to look through pages methodically in order to gain an understanding
of the particular period. Topics may be selected from articles,
advertisements, broadsides, or other features appearing in the selected
periodical.  
When you have selected a topic, prepare a detailed, written description of the
feature, its essential characteristics, how it works, and its relationship to
the surrounding landscape. This description should be specific and include
overall dimensions, form and shape, materials, structural system, hardware,
decorative features, mechanical equipment, or other appropriate components.
However, content will vary according to the topic. For example, the features
of natural landscapes are very different from those of the built environment.  
It may be necessary to consult the supplemental reading list to expand your
understanding of the feature, but you should draw primarily from your
periodical research. Your writing should be supplemented by illustrations.

**PART 2**.  
Repeat the process that you used for Part 1, but, using either the same or a
different periodical, scan each issue for another two-year period separated
from the first review by at least thirty (30) years. Identify either the same
topic or feature that you described in Part 1, noting the changes, or a topic
as closely related to the first as possible. Again, prepare a detailed written
description but also provide a comparative analysis. What changes have
occurred over thirty years?  
When you have completed this library research, conduct field study in an
effort to locate an example of the feature that you have described in either
Part 1 or Part 2. Include a written description and comparative analysis of
this feature. Again, illustrations should be part of your work.

**BE FOREWARNED**. This type of research cannot be conducted as a last-minute
endeavor. It is vital that you begin work early in the semester and tackle the
project in small, manageable pieces. By doing so, you will produce better work
and enjoy it much more.

**SHORT PAPERS (1-3 pages)**

 All papers should be typed and double-spaced.

1.  **Interview a FL teacher with 3+ years of experience.** _Due: Week 8_

  *    Name, School, Languages, Levels, Years of Experience
  *    Why did he/she become a FL teacher?
  *    What does he/she consider to be important characteristics of an effective foreign language teacher?
  *    What does he/she do in the way of professional development, including language practice?
  *    What does he/she recommend to a new FL teacher?
  *    What are his/her views on the philosophy of foreign language teaching, proficiency, text exercises, culture, and planning.

 2.  **Why Study Foreign Languages?**     _Due: Week 5_

In the form of a letter to the editor, present a rationale for the inclusion
of foreign languages in the curriculum (PK-12).  (Chapter 1 in Curtain &
Pesola's book and Appendix C of the Ohio Model will be helpful.)

> _We all know that school budgets are under attack by citizens, and
particularly property tax payers in local communities, because of the
difficult economic situation.   As a result, the Supt. of Schools in our
district will present a proposal to the School Board at the next meeting to
make cuts in the foreign language program in the four middle schools and the
two high schools.  Specifically, the proposal would eliminate (1) the FLEX
program in the 6th grade  (9 weeks each of French, German, Latin and Spanish),
(2) the Spanish, French, and German programs in the 7th and 8th grades, which
are equivalent to one year at the high school level, and (3) the fifth year
levels in French and Spanish.  As a FL teacher (and possibly a parent too),
you are very concerned about this proposal.  You believe that there are areas
of the budget that should be reduced first before the academic program in
languages is cut drastically.  Write a letter to the editor of your local
paper on the value, both to the individual and to the country, of foreign
language study from the elementary grades to the high school.  Give well-
defined reasons supported by arguments that will convince administrators,
parents, and other tax payers that cuts should not be made in the FL program._

 3.  **Observation papers**

> Write a one-page summary of each of your observations: two of A.U.
university FL & ESL classes (due _Week 14_ ) , one of an immersion classroom (
_due week after immersion school visit_ ) .  Use the _A.U. Foreign Language
Education Observation Form_ as your guide.

**FLTEACH**   _ _FLTEACH_ is a Listserv list founded in January 1994 by Jean
LeLoup and Robert Ponterio and running on a computer at SUNY/Buffalo.   The
topic of the list is foreign language teaching methods including high
school/college articulation, training of student teachers, and curriculum.
Current membership includes colleagues across the country as well as around
the world.  We will use the first few minutes of each class to discuss the
issues from the previous week.  All students should subscribe immediately
after the first class session.  In order to subscribe:_

 Send a message to:                     LISTSERV@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu  
                        In the message put only the following:          SUBSCRIBE FLTEACH firstname lastname    
                                        Example: SUBSCRIBE FLTEACH Snow White 

 Send the message just like that--no signature or anything else. You will get
a welcome message by return e-mail with instructions on how to use FLTEACH.
You might want to consider other options that are available.  (For example, by
subscribing to the DIGEST option, you will get messages only once a day under
one heading "FLTEACH".)

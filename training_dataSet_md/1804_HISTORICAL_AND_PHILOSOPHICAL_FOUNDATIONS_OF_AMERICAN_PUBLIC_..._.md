Course Description:

Philosophical foundations include an examination of a variety of philosophies
of education, including idealism, perennialism, pragmatism, marxism,
existentialism, romanticism, perspectivism, and W.E.B. DuBois' philosophy of
education. Historical foundations include brief examinations of ancient
Egyptian and Greek education, medieval education, post-medieval, and the Age
of the Enlightenment. Our examination of American education includes the
colonial period, the rise of the common (public elementary) schools,
antebellum and postbellum periods, the history of special/vocational
education, the twentieth century, rise of the public high school, and the
effects of the civil rights movement on education. Each student must complete
ten clock hours of field experience in public schools and cultural centers,
and write a field observation report. Finally, students will be exposed to
relevant research sources on the Internet, which they will be asked to
consider when completing their course assignments (please see below).

Packet. Chicago, Il.: Abacus Publishing, 1998.

Incompletes Policy

Only students who are receiving a grade of C or better (=70 points minimum)
are eligible for an incomplete at the time they request it. This means they
should have accumulated at least 70 points even to be considered for an
Incomplete, except in extenuating circumstances, such as, hospitalization, or
the like, where the student had no control over the situation. Students should
have had an excellent attendance record, and a valid reason of why they should
be offered an incomplete, before one can be assigned. The instructor does not
consider the need to read over the required reading assignments, or more time
to complete any of the other class requirements, as valid reasons.

Recommendation Letters

As a general rule, recommendation letters will not be completed by the
instructor before the student has completed all requirements for the course,
and has been assigned a final grade.

Mid-term Make Up Policy

Only students with written medical or job-related excuses may take the mid-
term exam at a date other than the one announced in class. All students with
such written excuses taking the mid-term examination at another date must: (a)
show proof of such written excuses before being allowed to take the mid-term
examination; and (b) take the mid-term examination on the same date and at the
same time, usually 1 week after the regular exam date. Date of the mid-term
make-up exam will be announced by the instructor in class.

Attendance Policy:

For each hour a student has been absent, he/she loses 1 point. To have an
absence excused, a student must have a legitimate excuse, including a written
statement from a health professional, qualified employer, and the like.
Students who walk in class after attendance has been taken, will be marked
"tardy." Three tardy marks are equivalent to 1 absence point. Students who are
tardy should notify the instructor at the end of the class period of their
presence, so that they will not be marked absent. Students should attend class
for at least 30 minutes per 50 minutes of class time to be marked as either
tardy or present. Otherwise, they will be marked "absent." For example,
students who leave right after attendance is taken will be marked absent.
According to the Official Academic Regulations regarding Class Attendance in
the Undergraduate Catalogue, students with more than 6 hourly absences from
class may be dropped from the course by the instructor.

Rules Regarding Classroom Decorum:

1\. No eating in the classroom.

2\. No children are allowed to attend. Please find alternative child care
facilities for your child(ren).

3\. Noone who is not officially registered is allowed to attend.

4\. No form of disruptive behavior will be tolerated.

Students who break the above rules may be asked to leave the classroom.

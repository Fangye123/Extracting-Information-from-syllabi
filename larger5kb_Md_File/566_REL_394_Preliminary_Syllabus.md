**Course Description:**

**Caves to Cities** is the topic of this semester's class.  The research
project will be a collaborative class effort to create a virtual version of
humankind's first urban city environment.  Each student will specialize in one
aspect of the city:  the first tax collectors and bureacracy;  temples, sacred
spaces and the priesthoods, royalty: public and private; domestic architecture
and homelife; agriculture and irrigation;  the military, soldiers and war;
harnessing animals -  wild and domesticated; and many others.

REL 394 provides an introduction to the study of archaeology and excavated
artifacts from the Ancient Near East with special reference to the lands of
the Bible (Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran,
Libya, Greece, Rome).  Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and an
research project based on the USC Archaeological Research Collection, students
gain an understanding of major archaeological discoveries, excavation methods,
and the history, religion, art and geography of the Ancient Near East.  This
class explores how archaeology and textual (including biblical) history
dialogue with each other as independent sources that have been used to
illustrate, amplify and adjust readings of the ancient past.

Classes include both lecture and "hands-on" components -- we work with the
objects in the Araceholgoy Research Collection to learn the characteristics of
objects from various ancient places and times; we repair and conserve ancient
objects;  we work on research for the class presentation. There will be two
field trips during the semester.

This course is the first of a two-part series, along with REL 494 (Advanced
Near Eastern and Mediterranean Archaeology) given in the Spring semester.
Between the two courses the history of the Ancient Near East from the Stone
Age to the Roman period will be covered.  In both courses, students will work
with ancient artifacts in the research collection.

(1)      Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East (Roaf,

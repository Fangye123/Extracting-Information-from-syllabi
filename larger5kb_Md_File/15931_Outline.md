Readings for specific dates may vary slightly from the following table as the
pace of the class dictates. Students are responsible for keeping up with any
such changes, which will also be posted on this web site.

Underlined readings are links to web sites. Students are responsible for
learning how to use the World Wide Web to get readings. Students should print
out copies of the readings to bring to class. Plan ahead--the Web is a great
learning resource, but glitch happens. Do not tell me you could not get the
reading because the server went down ten minutes before class.

Readings marked "reserve" are available from the circulation desk of Chesnutt
Library. Students should also make copies to bring to class.

Assignments for presentations and critiques are indicated by the student's
initials in the right-hand columns. See [Requirements](requirem.htm) for more
information.

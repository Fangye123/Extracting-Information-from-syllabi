Course meets on Tuesday from 6:00-9:00 p.m. in ED 42, unless otherwise noted.

  1. ### Course Description:

This course examines social work's roles and issues related to effective
practice with individuals from culturally distinct backgrounds. The course
will have a lecture, discussion and multi-media format. Guest speakers from
across the state will share their experiences with students the United States
continues to become more diverse at a steady rate and by 2040 forty-seven
percent of our population will be from culturally distinct backgrounds. These
trends will be seen in the client populations served by social workers and
among the population that will make up the profession.

Social workers operate within the ethical guidelines prescribed by the NASW
Code of Ethics to intervene with all levels of client systems (individuals,
families, groups, organizations, communities, and institutions). Ethical
standards provide guidelines for social workers' responsibility to clients
through cultural competence and knowledge of social diversity. Not to be
overlooked are social workers' responsibilities to colleagues, the profession,
and broader society. Part of this responsibility will include exploration to
obtain awareness of self and others to help in providing effective social work
practice as well as to work effectively and respectfully with colleagues.

Social Work 5800 presents knowledge, explores values, and addresses issues
important for successful social work practice with individuals from culturally
distinct backgrounds, their families and their communities. Groups to be
addressed are African Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, Native
Americans, Hispanic/Spanish Speaking Americans, individuals with disabilities,
gays/lesbians/bisexuals, women, and those from limited socio-economic groups.

  2. ### Introduction

The Master of Social Work curriculum is based on the generalist social work
practice model. The social worker practicing from the generalist social work
practice model operates within the ethical guidelines prescribed by the NASW
Code of Ethics and utilizes the problem-solving process to intervene with all
levels of systems (individuals, families, groups, organizations, communities,
and institutions). Assessment using the generalist social work practice model
is grounded in a systems and person-in-environment framework with the goal of
identifying multiple potential points for intervention. Interventions
utilizing the generalist social work practice model attempt to prevent or help
solve difficulties within the functioning of the client system as well as
enhance and strengthen the inherent capacities of a wide range of diverse
client systems. The generalist social work practice model advances problem-
solving methods that are infinitely flexible in their application. The
concepts of the generalist social work practice model guide the curriculum
plan and student learning objectives.

**The MSW program assumes two levels of professional preparation:**

Foundation level generalist social work practice (defined as completion of an
accredited BSW program and the summer bridge courses or completion of the
foundation year of the MSW program) and advanced generalist social work
practice (defined as successful completion of the advanced or concentration
year of the MSW program). Both levels of preparation include the study of the
nine curriculum areas but the advanced generalist level is distinguished by
increased complexity, depth, and range of knowledge and skills reflected in
preparation for different practice roles.

**Foundation Generalist Social Work Practice:**

Foundation generalist social work is the focus of the first year of the full-
time MSW program. The foundation generalist social work practice model has two
central features. It is problem-solving centered, rather than methods driven
and it uses the ecological or person-in-environment perspective for assessment
and intervention. This perspective demands that the practitioner not only
views the individual social functioning that includes both individual and
environmental factors, but also focuses on the transactions between individual
and environment. The foundation generalist social work practitioner is
prepared for beginning level social work practice. The foundation year of the
MSW program is built on a liberal arts perspective and provides a generic
foundation for generalist social work practice. It is informed by bio-psycho-
socio-behavioral and ecosystems knowledge, requires students to be
theoretically and methodologically open, involves intervention at all system
levels, focuses on practice in rural areas, and is research based.

Six foundation generalist social work practice roles mastered by MSW students
in their foundation year include: broker, coordinator, enabler, mediator,
advocate/activist, and educator.

**Advanced Generalist Social Work Practice:**

The second or concentration year of the full-time MSW program prepares
students for advanced generalist social work practice. Advanced generalist
social work practice is an especially appropriate and relevant specialization
for social workers practicing in rural or frontier areas. Preparation for
advanced generalist social work practice provides the knowledge and skills for
effective and autonomous practice with systems of all types and sizes. The
advanced generalist concentration year builds on the knowledge, values, and
skills mastered at the foundation generalist social work level. The advanced
generalist social work curriculum requires that students have greater
theoretical and methodological sophistication; increased ability in the
selection and integration of practitioner roles; increased ability to
integrate research into practice; a greater depth in the provision of services
in and with larger systems such as administration, supervision, policy
analysis, and social planning; increased ability to analyze value and ethical
dilemmas; increased ability to prevent or help solve difficulties in a wide
range of diverse client systems; increased skill in providing leadership
within organizations, the community, the profession, and in the broader
environment; increased skill in interdisciplinary collaboration, and increased
ability to address issues of social and economic justice especially with
populations-at-risk.

In addition to the six foundation generalist social work practice roles, the
advanced generalist social work practitioner employs the following five roles:
clinician, supervisor, administrator/manager, planner/developer, and
researcher.

  4. ### Academic Dishonesty

University Regulation 802, revision 2 (1992) prohibits any form of academic
dishonesty. An act is academically dishonest when it is an act attempted or
performed which misrepresents one's involvement in an academic task in any
way, or permits another student to misrepresent the latter's involvement in an
academic task by assisting in the misrepresentation. (See entire text of
UniReg 802 in Appendix of Student Handbook.)

  5. ### Non-Discrimination Statement

The University of Wyoming and the Division of Social Work endorse a campus
environment characterized by diversity, free inquiry, free expression and
balanced by interpersonal civility which has always been, and continues to be,
a top priority of the University of Wyoming. Civil discourse is an essential
aspect of the search for and transmission of knowledge. Words and actions that
promote and encourage self-worth, respect and dignity are consistent with the
university's mission. Conversely, words or actions that reflect prejudice,
stereotypes and discrimination are antiethical to the mission of the
University and can not be countenanced. Specifically, racist and other
discriminatory or harassing conduct based on gender, color, disability, sexual
orientation, religious preference, national origin, ancestry or age impair and
disrupt legitimate university functions. Every effort, within the context and
protection of First Amendment rights, will be expended to eliminate such
conduct from the campus community. Teaching our process that must take place
within a constructive and harmonious multicultural/ethnic environment here at
the University of Wyoming. It is the obligation of the faculty, staff,
students and the administration of the University of Wyoming to provide this
environment.

It is the policy of the Division of Social Work to accommodate students with
disabilities, pursuant to federal and state law. Any student who needs
accommodation because of a disability should inform the instructor at the
beginning of the course. Students with disabilities are also encouraged to
contact Student Educational Opportunity, Knight Hall, 766-6189.

  6. ### Attendance

Attendance at each class is expected of all students. Any student absent from
20% or more of class sessions is subject to failing the course. Since the
course will be mainly lecture, guest speakers and videos, it is best to be
present for all classes. If you miss a class, you will be responsible for
getting material from a classmate. Do not ask the instructors for lecture
notes, etc. The final exam will include information gleaned from lecture
material.

**First Thoughts~**  
You and I-  
We met as strangers, each carrying a mystery  
within us. I cannot say who you are.  
I may never know you completely.  
But I trust that you are a person in your own right,  
possessed of a beauty and value that are  
the Earth's richest treasures.  
So I make this promise to you:  
I will impose no identities upon you, but will  
invite you to become yourself  
without shame or fear.  
I will hold open a space for you in the world and  
allow your right to fill it with an authentic  
vocation and purpose. For as long as your search  
takes, you have my loyalty.

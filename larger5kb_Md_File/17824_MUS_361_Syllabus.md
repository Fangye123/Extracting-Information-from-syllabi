  * **One special assignment** (in lieu of class lecture sessions while Dr. Martin is in Brazil).   Using your textbooks, the library, and the internet, research the **history of organized church music ministry** from Biblical times up to the present day.   The report of this research may be in text form or an outline or any other format the student(s) select.  **_Students may work together on this project_**.   We will discuss the report(s) during class on **Friday, January 25**.
  * **Short paper** on your **philosophy of church music ministry**.   Length: 500 to 2500 words.  Due **Wednesday, February 13**.   This paper should tell why we need to have music ministry in our churches, what the role of music ministry should be in the life and work of the church, what the music ministry should include, and what the role of the music minister or music director should be.  The paper will present your own opinion and viewpoint, yet it should be supported by adequate logical argument, and you may use outside sources (with proper citation, of course).
  * **Major project**.   Create a **web site** for a local church's music ministry (either an actual church with which the student is affiliated or a hypothetical church).   Due **Monday, April 29**.   The web site must include:
    * "front page" or introduction
    * statement of philosophy (perhaps a capsule summary of the student's Short Paper)
    * children's choir page
    * adult choir page
    * Optional: a staff page, a handbell and/or instrumental page, a coming events page, a links page, anything else the student thinks is appropriate

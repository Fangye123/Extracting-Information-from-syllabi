The History of the Balkan Peoples, 1453-1918

The countries of the Balkan peninsula include Greece, Bulgaria,
Albania, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Serbia, and
Macedonia.  Most of them share the long historical experience of
belonging to the Ottoman empire.  Between 1800 and 1878, many of
them achieved independent statehood; since then, the struggle to
consolidate and maintain independence has dominated their
history.  This course will consider the history of this region
from 1453 to 1918, the period in which the region was dominated
by the Ottoman empire.  It will evaluate Ottoman rule in the
Balkan peninsula, the collapse of Ottoman authority, and the rise
of independent nation-states.  I hope that the course will
prepare you to better understand the turbulent politics of the
Balkan states today.  Perhaps it will allow us to throw off some
of our preconceptions about the strange region once known as the
"Near East."

I have been working on a World Wide Web home page for the past
several months.  In it, I have established links to quite a few
resources for the study of Eastern Europe.  Given what is
currently available on the web, its focus is on the present.  So,
although the page probably will not be of help to students in
their studies and paper-writing for this class, it is worth
taking a look at for those interested generally in the Balkans
and Eastern Europe.  The URL is listed at the top of this
syllabus.
Required books:

Norman Itzkowitz, The Ottoman Empire and Islamic Tradition

Mark Pinson, ed. The Muslims of Bosnia-Hercegovina: Their
Historic Development from the Middle Ages to the Dissolution of
Yugoslavia

Charles and Barbara Jelavich, The Establishment of the Balkan
National States, 1804-1920
Ismail Kadare, Broken April
Requirements: See attached sheets
Your grade in the course will be determined by tests and other
written assignments.  Although I will not take roll and do not
count attendance in calculating grades, I consider your presence
and participation mandatory.  That means arriving on time,
leaving when class is over but not before, and reading the week's
materials before you arrive for class.  

1. There will be 100 points available to all class levels
2. Everyone will be required to take a midterm and a final.
3. Each of you must turn in weekly commentary, or journal, on the 
   readings, to be described below.  This will be worth a         
   cumulative total of 10 points, given at the end of the         
   semester.
4. For specific requirements of each level, see accompanying      
   sheets
5. If you cannot complete an assignment on time, call me before   
   it is due.  Otherwise, I will subtract 2 points per day for    
   each day it is late.
Journals:

With the listing of weekly topics and readings below, there are
questions or themes pertaining to the weeks readings which you
should address in a notebook.  I am not asking for well-written
essays.  Instead, commentary on the reading and brief
consideration of the questions at hand will suffice.  Hand it in
in class each Wednesday, and I will have them ready for you to
pick up by Thursday afternoon.  From week 14, there will be no
need for you to maintain this journal.

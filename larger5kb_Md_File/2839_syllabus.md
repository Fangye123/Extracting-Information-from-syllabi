AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE 1878

_

COURSE DESCRIPTION:_** The theme of this course is the making of modern
America. Over the next sixteen weeks we will trace the historical development
of our modern national institutions and social and economic structures. In the
late nineteenth century enormous economic and social changes resulting from
industrialization and urbanization led to massive upheaval in American
society. Pre-industrial political and ideological structures were inadequate
to handle the new world created by industrial capitalism. Further, U.S.
expansion onto the world stage presented major ideological and logistical
problems for Americans. The evolution of the modern activist state was an
attempt to resolve these conflicts and contradictions. The hard-won Liberal
Consensus eventually unraveled, however, producing a backlash against the
activist state. This course will tell the story of this process, with the goal
of understanding how economic, social, political, and ideological components
of culture interact to create social change.

_**

COURSE OBJECTIVES**_:  
1\. To develop critical and analytical thinking and writing skills.  
2\. To comprehend several basic principles of historical thinking such as:
change and/or continuity over time, multiple causation of historical events,
origins of present problems, and historiography.  
3\. To learn to interpret historical materials.  
4\. To understand the historical development of modern America as
characterized by four themes:

> a. Industrialization & urbanization  
>  b. The bureaucratic national state  
>  c. The U.S. as a world power  
>  d. Mass culture & cultural conflict

TEXT:**_ _America: A Concise History_ , Volume 2 Since 1865. Henretta, Brody,
& Dumenil, eds. _Second Edition_ **  
**

**ASSIGNMENTS: _ALL ASSIGNMENTS ARE DUE AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS. LATE
ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED_**

**1\. EXAMS:** You will have 4 unit exams, consisting of multiple choice,
identification,  & a short essay. I will conduct a review session on the
Tuesday or Thursday closest to the exam from 3:00 to 4:20 in Henderson Hall
108. Students who attend these sessions generally do far better on the exams
than students who do not. In order to attend these sessions, however, **you
must have completed all of the questions on the study guides (see below). I am
no longer allowing people to come to these if they have only highlighted the
book. I need to see actual notes answering the questions. You do not have to
have looked up all of the IDs, and if all you have done is look up the IDs,
you MAY NOT attend the sessions. ** I will be in my office for half an hour
before the review. Please stop by with your study notes to let me check them
before the session. If you cannot stop by the office beforehand, catch me at
the beginning of the study session.

**

POLICY ON MISSED EXAMS:  Because I drop your lowest grade, I do not allow
early or make-up exams except under the following very specific circumstances.
**Students who must miss an exam for a legitimate, documented school activity
may arrange to take the exams _before they leave town._ They must negotiate
this at least one week in advance. **** Students who miss an exam for a
legitimate, documented medical emergency, personal tragedy, or extenuating
family circumstances may take a make-up exam during the final exam period. A
doctor's appointment is not an excuse for missing an exam unless it is a
medical emergency. Since you will be taking a different exam than the one
given at the time you missed, this must also be arranged in advance. You have
one week after the missed exam to contact me and explain, using the
appropriate documentation, why you need a make-up. _I reserve the right to
refuse to allow a make-up exam if I think I am being conned._ All test
policies concerning study aids will be honored with early or late exams.

2\. **" STUDY AID:" **You will be allowed to bring a "study aid" consisting of
one 8x5 index card into the exam. You may write on both sides of the card. OR
you may use ONE SIDE of a standard piece of paper.  The purpose of this is
twofold. First, it eliminates cheating. Second, preparation of the aid forces
you to study. There are study guides linked to this web page that will tell
you exactly what to study for each exam. My exam questions come straight from
these guides. There will not be any material on these tests that are not
mentioned on the guides. Consult the reading assignments outlined below on
this syllabus and click on the appropriate study guides _.   _There is also a
document that explains my test construction and gives you tips on how to
prepare for them and how to write good IDs and essays. Click on [__What to do
With Dr. O's Exams__. __ ](what-to-do.html) **Using more than one card or both
sides of the full sheet is cheating. Anyone caught cheating will fail the
entire course. If you are caught cheating before the drop period closes, you
will not be allowed to drop the class in order to escape the consequences of
your behavior. Rather, I will bring charges against you according to
University policy.  ** [  
](what-to-do.html)

3\. **QUIZZES** : To help facilitate good classroom communication, I give
several short, diagnostic, in-class quizzes over my lectures. These will be
open-note quizzes consisting of a few multiple choice questions and sometimes
some IDs. These quizzes serve 3 purposes. First, they reward attendance since
you have to have attended the lecture to answer the questions. Secondly, they
let me know if I am getting my main points across because I test what I think
I said. Occasionally, I find that most of the class misses a particular point.
That lets me know that I have not communicated clearly, and it helps me
improve my teaching. Finally, the quiz highlights how students take notes and,
hopefully, trains them to take better ones.

    Quizzes are only given in class and they are not announced. If you miss a quiz, then you just miss out on the points. Students who miss a quiz for a legitimate, documented school activity or a legitimate, documented medical emergency, personal tragedy, or extenuating family circumstances may make up the points by answering a 5th ID on the next test.  Please remind me what you are doing on the test since I am overextended and sometimes forget who has been promised what. They must, however, provide me with documentation regarding the missed class. _I reserve the right to refuse to allow this if I think I am being conned._  

4. **LETTER TO AN ELECTED OFFICIAL:** **** Because the purpose of requiring this class is to instill  "good citizenship" in students, you are required to contact an elected official either at the local, the state or the national level, and write him or her a letter about any topic you chose. This letter must be well thought-out and written. You will turn in **2 copies** of the letter **paper-clipped to an addressed, stamped envelope**. I will read and grade the letters and then mail them. Do not seal the letter in the envelope because then I cannot read it and grade it. (HELLO!) **   **

**     If you show up to class without a stamp or an envelope, you will not be
allowed to go get what you need.  You have 14 weeks to get this done, please
be ready to turn everything in when class begins. Late letters (meaning
letters given to me after class begins) OR single copies of letters OR letters
not accompanied by a stamped addressed envelope OR letters turned in with the
letter inside of a sealed envelope will not be accepted.  This means that if
you do not follow my directions, you will fail this assignment.  **Please
follow the guidelines on letter writing in [Writing Your Elected
Official.](writing-your-elected-officials.html) **I will dock points for not
following these guidelines.  **

    **Students may also opt to engage in public dialogue regarding the terrorist attacks on the United States**. For an overview of the public policy debate on the terrorist attacks see:   **[The Issues of Terrorism: An Historical and Cultural Paradigm](../history-201/terrorist-attack.html) and [How to Use the Web page](../history-201/how_to_use_the_terrorist_web_pag.htm)**

5\. **GRADES** : may be broken down as follows: **  
unit exams:** 4 @ 50 minus 1. While 4 @ 50 adds up to 200, your lowest test
grade will be dropped, so your true total points are 150.  
**letter to elected official:** 15 points  
**quizzes:** 25 points  
**total: 190-171 = A  
170-151 = B  
150-131 = C  
130-111 = D  
110-0 = F**

Because I drop your lowest grade, there will be **no make-up exams except
under the most extreme circumstances**. **Early exams are allowed under
specific special circumstances outlined above.**   All grades will be posted
to the web page according to your secret name. See: __[Grades,
202-002](Grades-202-002.html)  
NOTE: 5 OF THESE TESTS  (#2) HAVE NO NAME  
_ _

__**DOING WELL IN MY CLASSES:** __ It is in your interest to meet with me
about your grades, so please feel free to come by the office.  If you can't
make my office hours, email me and let me know when you are free and I will
come in and meet with you.  I am happy to go over tests or to advise you on
your study aid because I do genuinely want all of my students to succeed.
Consequently, I have outlined specific steps on my web page to help you do
your best in this class. If you are not willing to follow my suggestions, then
please do not waste my time asking for special breaks. Please do not come and
tell me that you are too busy to study for my class and ask what else you can
do. There is nothing else you can do. Finally, I am especially unsympathetic
near the end of the semester, especially if you have failed the first 2 or 3
tests and have never come to speak with me.  If you are concerned for your
grade, please talk to me  **early** in the semester. I will do everything that
I can (within reason, of course) to help you.  

    You have 16 weeks to come and see me. The 17th week is finals and, unless you have an emergency that will interfere with your taking the final and you need to tell me about it, I will not meet with you during finals week. I do this for two reasons. 1. By then it is too late to do anything about your grades since deadlines for turning in assignments are long past. 2. Students are often distraught during finals week and have been abusive and threatening to me in the past.  Waiting until next semester, then, diffuses potentially harmful confrontations. 

**All final grades are exactly that--final.** Do not ask me to change your
grade after the class is over. Unless I have made a mistake in math or an
error on the grade sheet (which happens occasionally) I will not do it.
**This includes asking to change your grade to an incomplete. Incompletes must
be arranged in advance.** If you think you have been given a grade unfairly
you have one year to appeal. See the student handbook for the appeals process.  

**6.** **ATTENDANCE  ** ** & TARDY ****POLIC** **IES** **:** ** ** Sometimes
students are unavoidably detained on their way to class and  cannot get there
on time.  When this happens, it is disruptive to both the professor and your
fellow students to come in and get set up in your seat. I ask, therefore, that
_tardy students do not come into the classroom_ but rather sit outside in the
hallway and listen to the lecture. Trust me, I am very loud and you will be
able to hear. You won't be able to see the board, but you can check your notes
later with someone who was there.  
      While I have given up on taking regular attendance, I strongly encourage you to attend class. Much of the material you will be tested on comes from the lectures, which do not merely repeat information from the text. Moreover, missing  class means you miss  quizzes.  Missing several quizzes can mean the difference in an entire letter grade. Finally, students who are happy with their grades sometimes stop attending classes in the last few weeks.  If you do this, I reserve the right to lower your grade by as much as one full letter. **Class attendance, however, does not automatically mean passing the class.  ** 

7\. **GENERAL EDUCATION: ** This course is designed to enable students to
achieve several general education outcome goals. A description of these goals
may be found through the History Department Home Page under "General Education
Requirements." Please see: http://www.tntech.edu/www/acad/hist/history.html.

8 **. ADA STATEMENT: **Any student who believes he or she will require special
consideration to meet the requirements of this course must consult the Office
of Disability Services (UC 112: x 6119) during the first week of classes. I
will work with the ADA office to the best of my ability to help you.

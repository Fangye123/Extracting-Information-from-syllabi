American Political Development

Course Description
 
The study of American political development offers scholars a vehicle
for exploring many dimensions of politics, state formation, and political
life in the United States. Accordingly, during the past two decades proponents
of various analytical approaches have embarked upon historical research.
From a formal theory perspective, history offers a rich source of cases
that may be used to test various propositions. Scholars who pursue the
rational choice version of new institutionalism have drawn upon historical
evidence to explore a number of significant concepts, including structure-induced
equilibrium and endogeneity. Practitioners of other approaches likewise
have turned to the past to better explain how the political system operates
today. The descriptive-narrative new institutionalists offer single-case
longitudinal and comparative studies to demonstrate the impact of past
decisions on later institutional, political, and policy development. This
research has yielded concepts like path dependence that have become a standard
component in accounts of institutional development. At the same time, scholars
of American political ideas and culture have traced the impact of debates,
narratives, and rhetoric on politics. American political development, in
short, has become the terrain upon which the different major approaches
to the study of American politics (and political phenomena more generally)
engage each other and break down many of the standard categories within
the American politics field. The results range from positive cross-fertilization
to sharp and sometimes angry debate.
 
In this seminar we will examine a number of approaches to the study
of American political development. Note that unlike a history course, this
one is not organized chronologically. Rather, each session will be devoted
to the discussion of a different analytical approach. It is to be expected
that there will be some overlap in historical coverage; indeed, that overlap
is desirable, because it will help us understand how different approaches
draw upon different kinds of evidence and illuminate different aspects
of the same phenomenon. I have selected readings that I regard as "productive":
that is, they have either generated significant discussion or have given
rise to further research that employs the same analytical tools. Students
will be encouraged to consider how the material we cover in the course
might be used as a springboard for their own research, up to and including
doctoral dissertations, in American politics and other fields.
 
Course Requirements
 
1. Complete assigned readings before class meetings and prepare seven
two-page summaries. I have limited the number of pages in assigned readings
to keep the reading assignment manageable, though of course you may disagree
with my notion of what that means. The syllabus is also on-line at http://urban.hunter.cuny.edu/~apolsky/.
Over the course of the semester you are required to submit seven typed
summaries of assigned readings. These summaries will be due at the start
of the class session at which the reading will be discussed. I do not accept
late summaries for any reason. I often ask certain students in advance
to be ready to lead the discussion of specified readings and to raise questions
about an author's method and use of evidence. It makes sense to write summaries
of readings you are designated to discuss. As indicated below, the course
grade is based in part on the summaries.
 
2. Attend class regularly and participate. Contribution to the class
discussion will be considered in the calculation of the final grade for
the course. (See below under grading.)
 
3. Complete the final exam. We will decide together whether the final
exam will be an in-class exercise or a take-home exam. Either way, you
must complete the exam by the scheduled date. I will grant an extension
only for documented, valid reasons, and I will give you only as much time
as you were incapacitated. Students who do not complete the final exam
will not be able to pass the course and will not be given an incomplete
grade.
 
4. Complete the research paper. As an 800-level research seminar, this
course requires a substantial research paper of standard journal-article
length (20-25 pages). I encourage you to select a topic that reflects both
the course content and your major interest in political science. For example,
if comparative politics is your major, you may wish to do a paper comparing
some aspect of American political development to that of another nation;
if you are primarily interested in international relations, consider doing
a paper on the development of American foreign policy or on how international
events have shaped domestic American development; etc. The research paper
may use existing secondary literature to explain some aspect of American
political development or may rely upon original research using archival
and other sources. To get a sense of how research in American political
development is presented, I recommend you review journals like Studies
in American Political Development or Journal of Policy History.
I will require that you identify a topic and prepare a preliminary bibliography
by a specified date during the semester. Failure to do so will, again,
make you ineligible for an incomplete grade in the course. The schedule
of topics below contains many bibliographic citations that may serve as
a useful starting point for your research. Late in the term students will
give an oral presentation to the seminar in which they will state the central
theoretical problem or question that guides their research, identify the
specific historical outcome(s) they seek to explain, present a "causal
story" that connects causal factors to the outcome(s), and indicate their
plan for carrying out the research needed to investigate the posited causal
connection. All papers must be completed by the end of the summer vacation
period and submitted to me by September 1, 2002.
 
Grading
 
Grading for the course will be based on the following:
Class participation and preparation: 25%
Final exam: 25%
Research paper: 50%
The class participation grade will be based upon the summaries and participation.
Timely completion of seven summaries establishes a base participation grade
of A-. If you submit fewer than seven, the base participation grade drops
to B; if you submit fewer than four, to C+. The participation grade will
also reflect your active, thoughtful contribution to the discussion. As
indicated above, you must maintain "satisfactory progress" in the course
in order to complete it in good standing or to be eligible for an incomplete
grade. You cannot attend sporadically, fail to submit summaries, fail to
identify a paper topic or present it to the class, tell me you are unprepared
for the final exam, and then expect to receive an incomplete. It is my
goal to ensure that you have finished all in-semester course requirements
and made a serious start on your research paper before the summer, and
to have you complete the course by September 1, 2002.
 
Books for Purchase
 
The titles listed here are available through the Hunter College Bookstore,
operated by Barnes and Noble, located at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street.
Note that these books are also on reserve at the Graduate School library.
Less expensive used copies of several titles are available on-line through
Amazon.com. Additional required readings have been compiled in a course
pack available from Campus Coursepaks, Inc. I will explain how this may
be purchased at the first class. One copy of the course pack has been placed
on library reserve, too, but I strongly recommend that you buy it.

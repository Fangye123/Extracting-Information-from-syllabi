### The Ground Rules:

Peer Review is a fundamental component of doing science.To help make your
discussion projects more scientifically sound, you are being called upon to
put forward your topics and ideas as well as provide needed feedback to your
fellow students.

These are discussion topics related to [Tropical Ecosystems of Costa
Rica.](/html/tropecocostarica.html) Please feel free to browse...

For students selecting a discussion topic for Tropical Ecosystems of Costa
Rica, [**Input Your Topic**](/FieldCourses99/FieldCoursesEntry.html), and then
review feedback here. Topics have to be approved by Dr. Cummins via this web
feedback. Specific topics are first-come, first-served.

###  A Note from Your Fearless Leader

**Hello Costa Rica Ecology Folks!**

I'm looking forward to our course. As part of our course expectations, each
student will present a twenty minute talk on a tropical ecosystem topic of
your choice during the course. These presentations will be at lunch time or in
the evenings. You may have as little as one day's notice!

To do a good job in your 15-20 minute presentation, you will need to hit the
library and WWW well ahead of time. We will use the World Wide Web as our
Discussion Feedback Central. You can see what other students are talking about
and I would expect that you would submit suggestions on other peoples topics
as well! In the selection of a topic, besides submitting a title, include a
synopsis of your discussion topic. What do you plan on teaching the class? Why
do you feel your topic is important? Include an outline of your talk and at
least 5 references! I will provide feedback(everyone is welcome to contribute
suggestions) via the web.

**The time line for completion is:**

-By Feb 28, 1999. Topic Selection, Paragraph, Outline, and Sources. First-Come, First-Served!

-March 30, 1999. Final Submission: Rewrite after having received feedback. 

**Topics can include** , but are not restricted to, anything related to
tropical ecology. Some topic ideas include land use, agriculture, climate
change, climate in the tropics, conservation, plants (epiphytes, emergent
trees, palms, understory plants); processes (predation in tropical rain
forests, competition, nutrient cycling, mutualism), hydroelectric power,
conservation, plate tectonics and volcanism in the Neotropics, indigenous
peoples, coral reefs in Costa Rica, mangrove ecosystems, deforestation,
species loss, or specfic species or family studies on reptiles, amphibians,
birds, or other specific organisms (e.g., monkeys, bats, sloths, lizards,
parrots, fresh water fish, mollusks, butterflies and moths) or other topics
addressing biodiversity and sustainability (the national park system, economy
and sustainability in Costa Rica, soil types, cattle ranching, the timber
industry, environmentalism, medicinal plants). Let your interests lead the
way. **Do not be constrained by these suggestions!** Look at what other
students have talked about in previous years. **** To "prime" your discussion,
you may wish to provide readings in advance to the class.

Let me know if I can help in any way. And, if you haven't done so yet, check
out the [Trop Ecosystems of Costa Rica Image Web
Page.](http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/html/TropEcoCostaRicaImage.html) You'll
get a taste of what's in store!

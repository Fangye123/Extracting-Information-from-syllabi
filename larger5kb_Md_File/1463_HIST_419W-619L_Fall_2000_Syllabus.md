**Course Description**

HIST 419W/619L proposes an interdisciplinary, comparative, and multimedia
approach to the question of historical memory in the modern world. The weekly
readings and discussions will consider the ways in which the past is recorded,
invented, commemorated, and contested in nineteenth- and twentieth-century
Latin America, the United States, and Europe. Recurrent themes will include
the distinctions between collective and individual memory; the relationship
between historical scholarship and popular memory; memory and nationalism;
"history wars," "culture wars" and other battles for the past; museums and
memory; the relationship between memory and identity; and memory and power.

**Course Organization**

The course meets once a week for two hours. Late in the semester, we will make
a site visit to the Holocaust Museum and Memorial in Washington, DC. Time
permitting, we will also visit the National Museum of American History.

**Course Requirements**

All students will be expected to be active participants in the weekly
discussions. Each week, one participant will lead a group discussion of the
assigned reading(s), and another will serve as the session's recorder.

Each student will be required to write a major paper. Seminar participants
will have the option of writing a historiographic essay on a specific problem
related to the politics of memory, a theoretical exploration of the question
of memory in contemporary historical studies, or a research paper based upon
original research. The paper length will vary by topic and scope, but
suggested lengths are 15 pages for HIST 419W and 20-25 pages for HIST 619L.

There will be no examinations.

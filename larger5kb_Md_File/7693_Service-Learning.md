**Getting Started  
Timeline for Organizing your Service-Learning Project**  
  
**Before the Semester Begins..**.  
1) Think about what kind of service you would like to do and what kind of
organization you would like to work with.  
2) Identify an interview with organizations that interest you.  
3) Contact a faculty member who will be able to assist you in reflecting on
your experience. This will be the professor of your class or may be a
professor of your choice if you are doing an independent study.  
  
**At the start of the Semester...**  
4) Attend a Service-Learning Orientation either in class or with CSL.  
5) Fill out a Service-Learning Interest Form and Risk Release form at a CSL
Orientation or in class.  
6) Complete application/paperwork as required by your service site. (i.e.
confidentiality statement, etc.).  
7) If you are working with an organization not on the Service-Learning
Partners (SLP) list, your site supervisor MUST fill out a SLP Application and
Letter of Understanding. It's YOUR responsibility to return these forms to the
Center for Service and Leadership (see PDF form files).  
8) Identify your learning objectives. Complete a Service-Learning Agreement
with your site supervisor. Provide your  site supervisor with a copy. Make two
copies and deliver them to the Center for Service and Leadership by the date
indicated on your syllabus. CSL will provide a copy to your professor. Make
sure you keep a copy for yourself!

**During the Semester...**  
9) Contact CSL as soon as possible if you drop the course or change sites.  
10) Complete journal entries/assignments as required and outlined in your
syllabus.  
11) Fill out the Timesheet in accordance with your syllabus..  
  
**At the End of the Semester...**  
12) Request and turn in documentation of your hours on organization
letterhead.  
13) CSL will send the Supervisor's Evaluation to all site supervisors. (This
is possible only if you have turned in your service-learning agreement to
CSL.)  
14) Fill out a Student Evaluation to let CSL know how the semester went! This
can be turned in to CSL or put in your final project portfolio.  
15) Stay in touch with CSL! If you continue to volunteer after the semester,
please let us know!  
****What is Service-Learning?**  
**  
Service-learning can be defined as "a form of experiential education in which
students engage in activities that address human and community needs with
structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning
and development. Reflection and reciprocity are key concepts in service-
learning." Service-learning is not simply volunteering, since volunteering is
not connected to academic course concepts. In a service-learning activity, the
professor grades the learning, not the service.

**Service-learning supports the academic environment by,**

  * Creating a value for community service as an integral part of students' intellectual experience.
  * Providing formal and informal opportunities for students to reflect on and discuss their volunteer experiences and community issues in and outside of academic classes. 
  * Encouraging all students to test their academic knowledge in the world through community involvement and to enhance their studied classroom experiences through experiential knowledge.
  * Stimulating a student presence in the community and a community presence on campus.
  * Promoting a student's sense of obligation to serve his/her community, and the institution's commitment to serve its larger community.

**Through service-learning individual student growth is promoted through,**

  * Experiencing different work environments, exploring career possibilities and making job contacts
  * Develop lifelong problem solving skills
  * Gaining competence by practicing social and professional skills
  * Expanding perspectives by working with and learning from people of different cultures, ages, and life experiences
  * Forming new friendships
  * Applying education to practical solutions
  * Making a difference in the lives of others
  * Engaging in responsible and challenging action for the common good
  * Experiencing, first hand, the issues discussed in the class

  
**Service-Learning Activities**  
  
* Tutoring youth in a local school  
* Working with learning or emotionally disabled individuals  
* Developing a promotional video for a local non-profit center  
* Answering crisis/suicide hotlines

**Process and Paperwork: Organizing Your Project**  

**SITE SELECTION: The Critical First Step**  
By carefully selecting your service organization, you will ensure that you
reach your learning objectives. Use the following questions/guidelines in the
process of selecting your site.  
  
**STEP ONE: Research Possible Organizations**  
Review the list of Service-Learning Partners (SLP) organizations that have
indicated they would like to host students, or contact the additional listings
at the Volunteer Center in your area (see appendix). Think about the course in
which you are involved, including course or discipline objectives and the
issue with which you would like to work. If you choose to work with an
organization not on the SLP list, then the organization MUST complete the SLP
Application and Letter of Understanding and return them to CSL.  
  
**STEP TWO: Make Contact with Several Possible Sties**  
Spend some time choosing your site and exploring your options in the
beginning: it will lead to a more positive experience in the long run. Select
four or five organizations and continue to follow through with them until you
have secured a placement. Don't count on one to work out; you could lose
precious volunteer hours while waiting for one to get back to you. Contact the
volunteer coordinator at each organization. Be persistent! Some staff are hard
to reach. Many agencies are understaffed and handling large caseloads. Be sure
to leave a phone number and the best times to reach you on their voice mail.
Once you have made contact, tell them that you are a GMU student and explain
the nature of your service-learning assignment.  

**STEP THREE: Interview and Be Interviewed**  
Ask questions about the organization to help you understand their needs. Keep
in mind that some organizations may mail you an application to submit;
processing time could take 2 to 3 weeks. Almost all organizations require an
interview. Visit the agency to become orientated to their services and further
discuss your roles and responsibilities.  
  
**STEP FOUR: Complete and Return Required Paperwork**  
Once you have secured a placement site, complete a learning agreement with the
assistance of your supervisor. Define the purpose of your community service
and set specific learning goals. Secure necessary signatures and submit two
copies to CSL and one to your supervisor. CSL will forward a copy to your
professor. Don't forget to save a copy for yourself. If for some reason you
change placement sites, complete and return to CSL your new service-learning
agreement.

**STEP FIVE: Coordinate Your Schedule with Your Agency**  
Schedule times to volunteer. Make sure the times are good for you and the
agency. Discuss GMU breaks that may affect your hours, i.e. Thanksgiving,
Winter Break, Spring Break, etc. Let the agency know about these dates.  
  
**STEP SIX: Fulfill your commitment**  
Be punctual and reliable in fulfilling your volunteer hours. It is mandatory
to notify the agency in advance if you are unable to come at your scheduled
time. Remember, you are a representative of GMU, your class, and CSL. Call if
your schedule changes.  
  
**STEP SEVEN: Evaluate your Experience**  
CSL will send the student volunteer evaluation to the contact listed on your
service-learning agreement. Ensure your supervisor completes it and returns it
to CSL before the end of class. Turn in your evaluation of the placement site
at the end of the semester at CSL.  
  
**Setting Learning Goals**  
  
When writing objectives, describe what you will learn, not what you will do.
Think about what you will gain and how this experience relates your academic
course of study. Use concise, measurable words to describe your goals, e.g.
identify, improve, define, apply, solve, compare, initiate, develop. Your
objectives should be developed in collaboration with your site supervisor and
professor.  
  
Your service-learning contract is the tool for gaining agreement between you,
your site supervisor, and professor on your education and work objectives for
service. By collaborating with your supervisor and professor you will ensure
that you will meet the goals which are important to you, realistic for the
setting and appropriate for the course.  
  
Completing the following statements may help you get started. Do not limit
yourself to these phrases, but use them as way of beginning to examine your
personal interest in relation to your service site.

**Special Considerations When Working With Children**  
  
The Center for Service and Leadership makes the following recommendations to
service-learning students and organizations to ensure safe interactions
between volunteers and children.  
  
Screening Volunteers:  
Service-learning students working directly with children should be screened
according to the guidelines of the agency before their placement at the site.
Screening may include a personal interview with the supervisor, police
background check, criminal history disclosure statement, fingerprinting and/or
letters of recommendation. Service-learning students working with children
should ask their agencies about screening procedures. Site supervisors have
their right to refuse placement of any student.

Training Volunteers:  
Prior to their placement, service-learning students working with children
should be informed of the potential liability risks in areas of sexual
harassment, child molestation, one-on-one situations and physical and mental
abuse. Service-learning students working with children should ask their agency
about training procedures to avoid these situations.

Appropriate Precautions:  
Service-learning students are advised to take the following precautions:  
* Avoid one-on-one situations that place you alone with a child or isolate you and the child from the main area of activity.  
* Respect the privacy of the child. Do not become intrusive or curious more than is necessary when working with the child.  
*Respect your own privacy. Some children express a natural curiosity about boyfriends or girlfriends, personal relationships, and even sexual activity.  
*Use common sense when discussing sensitive subjects and do not go into details about your private life.  
  
Reflection

"The ability to step back ponder one's own experience..."  

Human beings have a natural need to reflect on past experiences, to work
though the feelings associated with those experiences. Without adequate time
to do so, our thoughts tend to become distorted by frustration, emotional
overload and burnout. Reflection allows us to turn inward...

* Leads to thoughtful and thus more effective service.  
* Helps you to search for long-term solutions to problems or issues witnessed on-site.  
* Links academic content with service experience.  
**Reflection Models**  
One model for reflecting upon experience is to ask yourself, "What," "So
What," and "Now What". This is a three step model.  
  
**What?**  
Step one asks for a statement of facts and occurrences. Asking  "what" starts
the reflection process through descriptive questions:  
  
* What do I expect to get out of this experience (goals, purpose, ideas)?  
* What did I observe during my first visit?  
* What is the agency's mission? Its goals?  
* Are there other agencies in the community that have similar goals?  
* What part was the most challenging? Surprising?  
* What roles am I taking on?  
* What of myself did I share with others  
* What happened to me today?  
  
**So What?**  
Step two pertains to the difference the experience makes to you, the
individual. It looks at the consequences of the day's action and asks the
significance. This step challenges you to interpret the meaning of your
experience.  
  
* What did this experience mean to me?  
* What did I do that was effective? Why was it effective?  
* What am I learning about myself and others?  
* What did I do that seems to be ineffective? How could I have done it differently?  
* What values, opinions, decisions have been made through this experience?  
  
**Now What?**  
Step three is the process of applying the lessons you have learned to other
situations and contexts.

*Is it important for me to stay involved in the community?  
* What will the final results of my efforts be?   
* How will my efforts working with this agency contribute to social change?  
* How can I use what I learned in my coursework or in a future career?  
* What changes would I make in this experience if it were repeated?  
* Will I continue to be of service? Why or why not?  
* How does this experience exemplify or contradict course materials?  
**Keeping a Service-learning Journal**  
  
Service-learning is graded through assessing what is learned through service.
Grades are not based simply on completing your volunteer hours (although this
is important). Keeping a journal of your experiences is a valuable method for
documenting your progress in reaching academic goals. Through journal writing,
you describe, reflect and process your involvement in service. A journal
serves as a useful record of both your service activities and what you learn.  
  
A journal is not a log of events. It is a way for you to analyze the
activities in which you are engaged and the new things you are learning. In a
journal you can describe important events, and relate activities to your
overall objectives. Below are some suggestions on what to include in a journal
and what questions you might want to address. Use these suggestions in your
own way. Don't treat them like a grocery list, each to be answered in a
sentence. Some may not apply to you, or may need rephrasing for your
situation.  
  
**About your work:**  
  
* What do you do on a typical day at your service site? 

*Describe something you most disliked on site and why.  
  
* If you were in charge of the organization you volunteer for, what would you do to change/improve it? How hard would this be?  
  
* Tell about a person there whom you find interesting of challenging to be with. Explain.  
  
* What do you feel is your main contribution?  
**  
About yourself:**  
  
* How do people at your service site (staff and clients) see you?  
  
* What did someone say or do today that surprised you?  
  
* What compliments have you been given/not given and what did they mean to you?  
  
* Did you take (or avoid taking) any risks there lately?  
  
* What has happened that made you feel you would or wouldn't like to do this work as a career?  
  
* What kind of person does it take to be successful at this work? As a successful volunteer?  
  
* What have you done at your site that has made you proud?  
  
* What insights have you gained into people and working with people?  
  
* Tell about the best thing that has happened to you there lately; something you or someone else said/did, a feeling, an insight gained, a goal accomplished.  
  
* What's the most difficult part of your work? In terms of skills and knowledge? In terms of personal demands?

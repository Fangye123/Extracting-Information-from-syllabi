Required textbook

TEXT: PSYCHOLOGY by Sdorow and Richabaugh, 5th Edition, McGraw Hill.
Text readings should be read before the class for which they are assigned.
Lectures will be more beneficial if you have already read the assigned
material.



Exams and Grades
There will be three in-class examinations and a final.  Each exam will cover the lectures given since the
previous exam and will contain 60 multiple choice questions.  The lowest grade from the three in-class
examinations will be dropped.  Therefore, only the two highest scores on the three in-class exams will count
toward your class grade.  The final exam is mandatory.  If you should miss one of the three in-class examinations,
there will be no make-up exams, the two exams that you do take will be counted.  If you should miss more
than one of these exams, it is very unlikely that you will pass this course.  PLEASE TRY TO AVOID THIS.  The remaining 10% of your grade must be earned in one of the ways described below.

The FINAL EXAM will be held in our usual classroom(E100 VCC) on WEDNESDAY, MAY 1ST 
at 12:45-2:45
pm.  Note that this is different from our usual meeting time.  The final exam will cover material from the last
quarter of the semester.


Research Participation
Psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and of people's behavior.
Consistent with this definition, the faculty and graduate students of the
Psychology Department maintain active research programs in all areas of
psychological study. There are many ways for you to become familiar with
these research programs, but one unique way to learn about them is by being
a participant in a research study.
The ten percent solution. Throughout the semester, researchers
in need of participants will post their experiments on the internet. You
may sign up for these experiments via the internet using the procedures
outlined in a handout distributed on the first day of class. Participation
in these research projects will earn you research "credits". A research
credit is equal to approximately a half hour of your time. To earn the
final ten percent of your class grade you must (except under special circumstances
discussed below) earn ten research credits - approximately five hours
of participation.
Your participation in psychological research is vital to the continued
development of the science of Psychology. Without your participation, the
faculty and graduate students in the Psychology department would be severely
hampered in their efforts to understand people and their behavior. However,
you benefit from participation, too. Besides receiving class credit, you
will have the opportunity to know about research in a very direct way.
You will have the opportunity to talk to the researchers about their projects
(usually after your participation is complete) and every effort will be
made to make your participation a learning experience.
Some rules of the game. Participation in research
can be a rewarding experience if both the researcher and the participant
follow a few simple rules. For their part, the researchers must ensure
that your safety, comfort, dignity, and privacy are protected. To make
sure that this happens, each research project is carefully considered by
the University Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects (UCRIHS)
before it is posted on the web. UCRIHS only approves those projects that
ensure that your rights as a participant are fully protected.
If you can't come, cancel. For your part, you must
show up for the experiment(s) that you have signed up for and you must
participate in good faith. If you fail to show up for your experiment,
one research credit will be subtracted from the total you have earned for
each experiment you miss. If you cannot make an experiment that you have
signed up for, you may cancel, without penalty, at least one day in advance
of the experiment by following the directions on the handout.
Vote early, vote often. A word to the wise -- don't
leave all your research participation to the end of the semester. Avoid
the end of the semester rush, when there may be more participants than
research projects.
Extra Credit:  Ten credits of research participation
are required for the final 10% of your class grade. You may earn up to five
additional research credits (i.e., fifteen total credits). These additional
research credits will count as extra class credit, one extra point for
each extra research credit (up to five).
Conscientious objectors. I really encourage each
of you to participate in the research programs of the department, but occasionally
a student may choose not to participate as a subject. If for some reason,
you feel unable or unwilling to participate in research, you may choose
a different way to earn the final 10% of your grade. If you wish to choose
this option, please talk to the teaching assistant as soon as possible.

 Problems with your research credit:   On each in-class exam and on your final exam, we will ask you
to record the number of research credits you have earned to date.  To find this information, you should sign onto
the research participation web site and check your personal history.  This will tell you how many credits you have
earned and any penalties you have had deducted for missed sessions.  If this information is incorrect, you should
immediately contact:

Mrs. Seka Remsing,       Subject Pool Secretary
OFFICE: 137 Snyder Hall          PHONE:  355-9561   

EMAIL: seka.remsing@ssc.msu.edu


It is your responsibility to make sure your personal history is accurately recorded on the computer.  At the end of
the semester we will take your research credits from the computer, so if there is a problem, it could be reflected
in your grade for the class.


How to calculate your grade: At the end of every semester, there is much interest (and usually some confusion)
about how we calculate grades.  This work sheet should help you figure out what grade you have earned in the
class.

	List your three in-class exam grades.  These scores are the number of items you marked correctly (i.e., it
should be a number between zero and 60).

1.  Exam 1 grade ___________Exam 2 grade__________  Exam 3 grade _________

2.  Total of the two highest in-class exam grades (0-120)________ 

3.  Final exam grade (0-60) __________ 

4.  Total of lines 2 and 3 (0-180) __________

5.  Multiply line 4 by 0.50 __________ (do not round your answer, carry two decimal places to the next             
steps.  Your answer should be in this range: 0.00-90.00)

6.  Total number of research credits earned __________

7.  Subtract the number of research credits deducted for no-shows from line 6  (0-15) __________

8.  Add line 5 and line 7 __________.  This is your class total.  Do not round your total in any way.           Here is
how to convert this to a class grade.

90.00 - 100    = 4.0 
85.00 - 89.99 = 3.5 
80.00 - 84.99 = 3.0 
75.00 - 79.99 = 2.5 
70.00 - 74.99 = 2.0 
65.00 - 69.99 = 1.5 
60.00 - 64.99 = 1.0 
< 60 = 0.0 

Unfortunately, some of you will be very close to the line for the next highest grade.  There is
nothing I can do about that.  I cannot give you a grade you did not earn.  Please do not call me or the
TA to see if we will make an exception in your case.  We will not!

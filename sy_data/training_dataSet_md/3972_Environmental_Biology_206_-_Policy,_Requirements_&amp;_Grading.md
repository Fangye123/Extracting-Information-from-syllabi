**Environmental Biology 206**  
** The University of Arizona  **

**Course Policy, Requirements & Grading**  
Enrolling in ECOL 206 commits you to read all, attend all, participate fully.
Think of the topics in the syllabus as the organs of ecology, which function
together. Your brain is only 1.9% and your heart about 0.6% of your body, but
loss of either organ deprives you of more than those fractions of your life,
but try to live normally with the 1.9% brain or the 0.6% heart! You can't
understand the course if some of its parts are missing! Cross-check the course
plan with your engagement calendar, friend's wedding, and other events. We'd
enjoy having you in ECOL 206, but if you have commitments, however worthwhile,
which conflict with what we have planned, they cannot be excused as
substitutes. Chronic failure to attend and participate will result in an
administrative drop, with an E (see after "last dates", Fall Schedule of
Classes).

**Office Visits** : We value your input and the chance to get acquainted, so
feel free to visit. As a free introductory offer, a first visit to both your
prof and G.T.A. are REQUIRED within the first two weeks of the semester. Then
at first indication of a problem, you'll know where to find us. Let us help
you understand environmental biology - and get a high grade to prove it!

**Assigned reading and class procedure** : READ EACH ASSIGNMENT BEFORE CLASS!
BRING BOOK & assigned references FOR CLASS USE! I cannot talk fast enough to
recite it all in two 75 minute classes/week, and you can't write notes fast
enough to get it all down. So our first responsibility is to read each
assignment as listed below. We will usually begin with a call for questions-
yours first.

I will not try to repeat what I think you will fully grasp from reading the
textbook. Instead, I will focus on the more significant, controversial, or
difficult aspects. Do not allow me to assume that you understood all you read-
ASK QUESTIONS. If you have not read the assignment, how can you ask for help?
Subsequent use of the terms and reference to the concepts will be unfamiliar.
You will not only have a chance to have anything that is confusing clarified,
but those who ask get credit for asking! If you don't have questions, I'm sure
I can find some, so may call upon class members, either one-person-at-a-time,
or on paper.

**Curriculum, textbook, and reading notes** : I picked the most appropriate
text, but had to rearrange the text sequence to mesh with our climate and
semester calendar. We must schedule our trips and exercises to arrive at the
right place at the best time, prepared by reading each assignment BEFORE
attending each and every class, to get the most out of the experiences. Those
who do, do better, and enjoy the course more. Some even like it enough to
return to help us, as unpaid UGTAs, our web page designer, or outreach
volunteers!

**Information for the semester's budget** :  
Budget into your week at least 2 hours (only 3.6% of a week) preparation
(reading) for each hour in class, getting needed information and concepts,
with the following in mind:  
1 semester = 15 weeks = 27 lectures = 584 pages of text for $48 used.  
Average reading to prepare for each lecture = 22 pages = $ 1.80 worth.  
Average cost per lecture: $50- You'd think it was a rock concert, but you can
still hear!  
Study time between classes: Thurs. Tues. = 5 nights; Tues. Thurs. = 1 (just
Weds.).  
So don't try to cram half of the week's assignment into one day (Wed.).
PREPARE daily for the comprehensive FINAL EXAM.

**Attendance** : Required for ALL lectures, labs, and exams.Think the sequence
of lecture topics ("SYLLABUS") as interdependent organs of ECOL 206. Your
brain is about 1.9% of your body and your heart about 0.6%. Loss of either
organ deprives you of more than those fractions of your life- you just cannot
function if vital parts are missing. We assume that the synthesis, structure,
labs, and field trips of a formal course are a more expedient way to learn
environmental science than digging it out of the library, piece-by-piece, or
from the internet, or wading through the babble of often-ecologically-
illiterate "talk-show hosts". In class, we can address questions about
whatever you do not understand or accept- from the textbook, other assigned
readings, class, or current news. Your peers may be unhappy with you if you
disrupt their concentration by entering late, chattering in class, or leaving
before class is concluded. If it appears necessary to reinforce this,
unscheduled quizzes can be expected at 0930 or at 1040.

**Videos** : I will utilize several video programs or segments which treat
relevant topics in a more dynamic way than straight lecturing. Because of the
considerable investment in time and money to collect these tapes, which would
wear out rapidly from repeated use, as well as restrictions on use of
copyrighted programs, these will be shown only in the appropriate class or lab
section, and cannot be checked out if you missed class.

**Labs** : Attendance and Participation are required for all
laboratory/discussion sessions and field trips. These have been designed with
specific objectives, so there are no suitable "make-ups" for missed labs or
trips. If there were, we wouldn't waste time and resources on a lab- you could
just go and write extra papers. UA vehicles must leave on field trips
promptly, for we often have host experts waiting for us. Most labs will be
during the 2h 50 min time during the week as listed for your section.

There is a mandatory all-day (07:00-17:30) FIELD TRIP in the SANTA CATALINA
MOUNTAINS north of Tucson on Saturday, Sept. 25 ( We hate to use the word
mandatory, because it is so neat!) Southern Arizona's natural diversity gives
us unique advantages for environmental biology studies. In fact, from windows
on the north side of the main library, you can see the mountains where the
basic relationship between vegetation biomes and climate was developed!
[Students in environmentally-deprived eastern, metropolitan universities get
it only as book- learning!- (see Fig.5.2, p.95 in the textbook). For us, it's
real-life. See (ELM 76-77). REQUIRED: water, lunch, sun & rain gear, notebook.  
RECOMMENDED: Camera, binoculars. DO NOT BRING: boom box, casette player.

A lab book/field journal is required. This should be a standard 10.12 x 7.25,
5x5 quad, with sewn-in pages that resist high winds in the field. This is
exclusively for observations, data, and write-ups. A tree died to make that
notebook, and your TA does not have time to wade through extraneous material.
Do not tear out pages because the other end will fall out.

**Grading**  
**Letter grades:** A = 90%-100%, B = 80%-89%, C = 70%-79%, D = 60%-69%, E =  <
60%  

Grades will not be "curved". The 15 year- average grade for ECOL 206 has been
so close to 75% for a mid-C, that a curving adjustment would not have saved
anyone.

**Exams & qizzes** : will be given on dates listed, unless a change is
announced in class. There will be NO MAKE-UPS. In the event of certified
illness or tragedies or other official excuse, the final grade will a pro-
rated average of work completed. In the unhappy event of failing a quiz, an
office visit is mandatory to avoid a drop.

|  Weekly take-home exercises |  200 pts. (20%)  
---|---  
Quizzes (14 Sept., 02 Nov.), 50 pts each |  100 pts. (10%)  
Mid-term (07 Oct.) |  100 pts. (10%)  
Comprhensive final exam |  200 pts. (20%)  
Lab, field trips, lab reports |  300 pts. (30%)  
Oral & Written Project reports |  100 pts. (10%)  
  
* Points will be subtracted for missed activities).  
Each student prepares a written report on an environmental subject and
contributes this to a cluster of related oral presentations by your "think-
tank".

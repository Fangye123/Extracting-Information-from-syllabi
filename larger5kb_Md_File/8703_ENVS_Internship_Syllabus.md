##  Purpose of this Course:

The ENVS Internship Program is designed to help you connect your academic
studies to real world applications by offering academic credit for your
environmentally-focused work experience. This course emphasizes that earning
academic credit for work experience requires more than just showing up for
work and doing a good job. You will be required to complete a series of
assignments that are designed to encourage thoughtful reflection upon your
internship experience. Since there is no classroom for this course, you are
expected to be self-motivated and able to complete course assignments without
daily reminders.

##  Registration for Credit

To register for credit, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Identify your internship placement and site supervisor and determine the number of hours you will log.
  2. Complete the green "undergraduate internship study form" and return it to Kris Ansell-Bell at the front desk.  Freshmen and sophomores register for ENVS 199 (you may petition for upper-division credit) and juniors and seniors circle ENVS 404.  Each credit for which you register requires 30 logged hours for the term (3 hours per week for 10 weeks).
  3. Register for the internship credits using DuckCall or DuckWeb.  Upon receipt of the green form, we will clear you for registration, but _your registration is not complete until _you_ have added the class_.
  4. In consultation with your site supervisor, prepare your project/work description.   The description, along with the signed and completed "[PLE Agreement Between Student and Community Partner](contract.htm)," is due by the end of Week 2.

##  Course Requirements:

Internship Credit is offered on a pass/no-pass basis only.  In order to
receive any credit, you are expected to complete all assignments by the due
date. In addition, you will be expected to log the appropriate number of hours
to qualify for the number of credits for which you have registered. **All
reports may be submitted to the assistant coordinator via e-mail.   Contracts
and any hard copies should be placed in the assistant's mailbox in 10
Pacific.**

####  Project/Work Description:

This description serves as both a contract with your internship sponsor and a
contract with the Environmental Studies Program. The description should
explain the goals and expectations of the work you will be performing as well
as how the experience will enhance your program of academic study here at the
U of O. Attached to the description, you must submit the Student and Community
Partner Agreement form.

####  Updates #1 and 2

The update is your work progress log and should provide an opportunity for
thoughtful reflection during the course of your internship. This is critical
because the information that you provide in the log will still be fresh in
your mind and can serve as a valuable resource at the end of the term when you
prepare your final report. The update should contain the following
information:

  * Your name and ID#

> * The total number of hours completed to date

> * A description of the duties or tasks you have performed

> * A statement about how those duties or tasks have helped to further the
organization's mission

> * An analysis of how your experience relates to your academic studies.

####  Final Report and Site Description:

The Final Report should serve as a summary of your internship experience. If
you have created anything tangible (a report, GIS map, etc.), a copy should be
included with your report if feasible. The report should also reflect upon the
goals you set for the term in your project/work description. We recommend that
you rely on the description and your updates, and make reference back to them
as necessary. Remember that this is a learning process, and you will not be
graded on whether or not you met your initial goals. Our only concern is that
you have looked beyond the work itself, and gained valuable insight into the
process while making the link between academic study and work experience. If
you have questions about what we would like to see in the Final Report, please
do not hesitate to contact either of us for advice.

Included with the Final Report should be an [Internship Site

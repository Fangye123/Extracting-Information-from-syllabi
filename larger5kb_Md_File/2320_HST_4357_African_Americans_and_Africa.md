This course will look at the links between African-Americans and the African
continent. The connection between blacks in the Americas and their original
homeland has been ongoing. Various themes and issues that relate to African-
Americans and Africa will be examined and discussed during the course of the
semester. Themes and issues will include African influences on African-
American life and culture, slavery and slave culture, emigration and back to
Africa movements, African-Americans in Liberia and Sierra Leone, black
nationalism, black missionary movements, African-American perspectives and
perceptions of Africa, and African-American contributions to African history.

Emphasis will be placed on how African-Americans have historically viewed and
associated themselves with Africa, both as their place of origin and as a
prospective homeland. We will explore the kinds of controversy and debate
Africa has raised in the African-American consciousness and on the dilemma
many African-Americans historically faced in their relationship to Africa. How
African-Americans have written about Africa will be an important theme as we
look at primary documents. The course will attempt to take issues up to the
present, by looking at how African-Americans respond to Africa and African
issues today.

Course Requirements**

A midterm paper (30%), final paper (30%), quizzes (20%), and weekly class
participation and attendance (20%) will make up the course grade. Late papers
will not be accepted without a valid excuse (documented illness or death).
Make up quizzes will not be allowed. We will have structured discussion
sections where students will be expected to raise questions and issues on the
reading material, as well as analyze the documents. Each student will be
required to do all the readings for the course, attend class regularly and
participate in class discussions.

This course is thematic. For a chronological historical background to the
themes this class will discuss, I recommend John Hope Franklin's _From Slavery
to Freedom_ or any general African American history text.

Course Requirements:

Students must attend two hours of lecture and one hour of discussion section
each week. **Lectures will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:00** , and
discussion sections will be arranged for Wednesdays and Fridays, beginning the
second week of classes. Grades will be based on section participation
(including short written assignments), a midterm and a comprehensive final
exam.

Students must come to section prepared for discussion by completing the
required readings beforehand.



The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:

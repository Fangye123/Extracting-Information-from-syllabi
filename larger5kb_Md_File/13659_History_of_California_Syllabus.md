        In this course, we will examine California history during the Native American, Spanish, Mexican, and American periods.  We will study the most important social, cultural, economic, political, and intellectual themes that define the history of California.  For example, we will examine the structure of native cultures; mission, pueblo, and rancho life; the trapper, settler, and miner invasions; the American takeover; the railroad; the industrial and service economy; Progressive reform; the impact of the Great Depression; the arrival of the Dust Bowlers; the impact of World War II; suburbanization; solutions for water and power problems; immigration; the information economy; and the desire if many people to leave the state.

**Course Work and Attendance**

    Your course grade will be determined by a midterm examination, which will count as twenty percent of your course grade; an essay assignment, which will count thirty percent;  a final examination, which will count forty percent; and attendance and participation, which will count ten percent. 

    Since attendance will be a factor in determining your course grade, the only excused absences will be for verified medical necessity for you or a family member or a death in your family.  It is each student's responsibility to notify the instructor in advance, when possible, of an excusable absence and/or to notify the instructor on the first class day upon return from an excusable absence.  It is each student's responsibility to sign the attendance sheet during class.   


**Course Procedures**

    Make-up examinations will be given only for extraordinary reasons.  The final examination **_must be taken_** in order to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course.   No student will be allowed to take an early final examination.  No student will be allowed to take a late final examination without the consent of the instructor.  Consent will be given only for extraordinary reasons.  If you want to receive an Incomplete Grade for the course, you must have taken the midterm examination, turned in the essay assignment, and you must submit a completed Deferred Grade Form with an acceptable rationale to me by no later than the start of the final examination.  Only students with mental or physical impairments and the consent of the instructor will be allowed to tape record lectures.

**ACADEMIC HONESTY AND INTEGRITY**

    This course will be conducted under the highest standards of honesty and integrity.  Plagiarism or dishonesty on any part of the course work will result in a failing grade for the course.  All such cases will be reported to the appropriate administrative officials.  Student behavior will also be held to the highest standards of integrity.  Unacceptable behavior (such as racial or gender disrespectfulness or harassment) will result in removal from the course or a failing grade for the course.   
    
    
  

**ESSAY ASSIGNMENT**

    Describe and analyze five aspects of the "Californian Dream" that mean the most to you.  Explain why each of these aspects is significant.  Discuss the state of each aspect: is its importance in decline, is it stable, or is its importance increasing?  If you are a Californian, do you plan to continue living in the state?  If you are not a Californian, do you plan on moving to the state?  Why or why not? 

    Your essay must be six to seven pages in length.  Students are warned that computer down time or the tardiness of others is not an acceptable reason for extending the on time or late due dates. 

    You must submit the original copy rather than reproduced copy.  If you use quotations, you must provide author's name and page citations.  The essay is due by the end of lecture on Monday, April 22.  Late essays turned in thereafter but by the end of lecture on Wednesday, April 24, will receive a grade penalty of one grade (for example, from B- to C-).  Essays will not be accepted after the late deadline.  BOTH DEADLINES WILL BE STRICTLY ENFORCED.  Essays not given to me personally must be left with the History-Philosophy Faculty Secretary, University Hall 3612, so that the date and time of submission can be recorded on the title page.  Essays with excessive grammatical and/or typographical errors will receive a grade penalty of one-half a grade (for example, B- to C+).

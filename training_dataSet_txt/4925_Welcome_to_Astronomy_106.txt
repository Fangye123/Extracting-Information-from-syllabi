COURSE DESCRIPTION:

	Exploring the Cosmos, parts I and II, is designed to give you an
overall look at the history of astronomy, the techniques and equipment used
to make astronomical observations, the life cycle of stars, the theories of
the evolution of our solar system and galaxy, and the theories of the our
entire universe.  Part I of this course will cover chapters 1-8 and 17-24,
which include the basics of our view of the sky, telescopes, the nature of
light, our solar system, and the life cycle of stars all the way to black
holes.  Part II will cover the remaining chapters, which include the
evolution of galaxies, clusters and superclusters, basic cosmology, and a
survey of our solar system's bodies. 

	These courses are meant primarily for non-science majors, though
they are also the introductory courses for physics students with an
astrophysics interest.  Students will be expected to perform only basic
algebraic and mathematical calculations to support various theories; no high
level mathematics is required.  (Basic Algebra is a course pre-requisite!)  
While learning about the solar system and the stars, you will learn physical
relationships between quantities such as temperature, pressure, brightness,
distance, speed, angle, etc.  You will also learn to interpret data to make
informed decisions about astronomical theories, particularly in the
laboratory exercises which accompany the lecture. 

	The laboratory exercises will also include a simple observing
project which will be due later in the semester.  Other than that project,
there are few observational requirements for this course.  However, the
graduate students teaching the laboratory and I are all available to conduct
viewing exercises as required.  There are small telescopes in the astronomy
laboratory that you may check out from the lab instructor or from me.  If
you know of an upcoming astronomical event or would just like the
opportunity to look through a scope at whatever might be visible, please
make your request known and we'll schedule a viewing.  If you wish to be
notified of any last-minute observing activities, send me an email message
so that I may add you to my viewing list.  Also, the Von Braun Astronomical
Society has an observatory and planetarium on Monte Sano Mountain which is
open quite often to the public for planetarium shows and general observing.  
Visit their website at www.vbas.org for more information

HOMEWORK:
  Homework assignment due dates are listed below with assignments
due at the beginning of class, folded, stapled, with your full name written
legibly on the outside.  Many homework problems are based on information
contained in the "boxes" within the chapters.  Late homework may be
submitted TO ME with a penalty of 25% per day late; written excuses required
from an appropriate authority for no penalty.
 
RETURNS:
  Homework assignments will be returned in class within two class
periods.  All homework will be available before an exam.  If you are absent
when assignments are returned, you can retrieve them from a box 
outside my office.  Exams will also be returned in class within two
class periods or can be picked up from me during office hours after the
second class period; I do not leave exams in the box outside my office.
 
SOLUTIONS:
  After the due date, solutions to the homework assignments will
be posted on the main syllabus web page as gif files.  The
solutions are good study aids as I often supply more information than
necessary to answer the question.  This is my way of "going over the
homework".
 
EXAMS: 
 My exams reflect the homework, examples that I work in class and
discussions in lecture and in your book.  Exam grades may be scaled to give
a class average of 75%, should the class average be lower than this.  If 
you don't come to class and/or don't do homework, you will find it
difficult to pass the exams! No early exams.  Notification of absence for an
exam must be made within 24 hours of exam time. There is an answering
machine on my office phone for this purpose.  Makeup exams, which may be
oral or more difficult, will only be given for absences with a written
excuse from the dean.  

LABORATORY:
  The laboratory will be taught by a graduate student and/or experienced 
undergraduates.  The grade
will be averaged with your class grade as shown above.  Many students do
well enough in the lab to raise their overall class grade.  ATTENDANCE IS
MANDATORY TO PERFORM THE EXPERIMENTS; LAB REPORTS BASED ON EXPERIMENTS THAT
YOU DID NOT PERFORM WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
 
TENTATIVE LAB SCHEDULE
PREFLIGHTS/WARM-UPS/QUIZZES
 I am trying out a new teaching style that tries to use the WWW as a
fast-response feedback loop. Before each Wed/Fri class, a Quiz will be posted on the
WWW, which must be completed before 8:00 AM on the day that it is assigned.
PLEASE do not try to take the quiz after the
deadline time, I will not be able to accept it. These quizzes will form the
basis of the following lecture. A web site describing this approach can be
found at the JiTT
Website.
 
GRADING:
The final grade will be derived from:

Exam #1----------15%
Exam #2----------15%
Final Exam---------20%
Labs-------------25%
Quizzes-----------10%
Homework---------15%


I use an absolute scale for letter grades:

  
90-100 = A
80--90 = B
70--80 = C
60--70 = D
00--60 = N/C


 Note that beginning in 2000, the "F" grade is replaced with a "N/C" for all
100-level physics courses. That is, failing will no longer reduce your GPA,
but it will be treated as if you had withdrawn.

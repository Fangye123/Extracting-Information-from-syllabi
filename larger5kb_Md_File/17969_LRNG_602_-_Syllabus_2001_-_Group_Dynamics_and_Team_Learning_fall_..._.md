In the best selling book _Emotional Intelligence_ Daniel Goleman (1995) argues
that interpersonal skills are far more important to success in organizations
than previously believed: "At best, IQ contributes about 20 percent to the
factors that determine life success, which leaves 80 percent to other forces."
We have all heard stories of engineers, programmers, and managers who have
exceptional technical skills to do their jobs, yet their careers are stymied
because they have acquired notoriety for their insensitivity to others and
inability to work with colleagues. Ultimately, our impact in organizations
depends on our ability to get along with others.

These so called "soft" skills have long been undervalued in management
education until the beginning of this decade when a couple of landmark reports
on the topic called for a radical redesign of executive education emphasizing
people management competencies. Since then scores of business schools have
redesigned their curriculum refocusing on people management skills.

In this context, the ability to work effectively in small groups is
increasingly seen as a critical competence for achieving organizational
effectiveness. Examples of small group contexts are top management groups,
board of directors, product development teams, cross-teams, or, in short, a
relatively permanent group comprising about six to twelve members. We have
evidence to suggest that small group interactions have a dynamics of their own
and that a knowledge of and familiarity with them significantly improves one's
ability to function effectively in such contexts.

_Group Dynamics and Team Learning_ attempts to provide an understanding of
group dynamics inherent in small group interaction. Using unstructured
learning environments (laboratory training method), you will engage in intense
levels of group interactions in order to learn from one another. You will get
plenty of opportunities to reflect upon your learning and communication styles
and the impact they have on others. The course will also explore various
aspects of group dynamics such as power, perception, motivation, leadership,
and decision-making. As a result, like in a laboratory, you will have plenty
of opportunities to experiment with and experience the relevance of several
concepts related to group dynamics. At the end, it is hoped that you would
have acquired a better sense of judgment, understanding, and competence
regarding how to be better facilitators of your own and others' learning in a
variety of group situations.

**Learning process**  
A student-centered approach is encouraged where each individual assumes
personal responsibility for his/her learning. Participation is necessary and
desired. Explorations of the subject matter one is dealing with in this course
tend to generate a fair amount of ambiguity. Uncertainty / ambiguity reduction
is essentially a social process. Actors in social and organizational worlds
make sense of their experiences by interpreting (talking about) them. When it
comes to group dynamics and team learning, the classroom is one place to
generate that dialogue. Together, it is an opportunity for us to be creative
and bold about our knowledge of groups and organizations.

  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND EVALUATION**  
1\. **Critical Book Review**  
Review a book dealing with group dynamics or small groups and write a critique
articulating the impact the ideas and approaches in it might have had on your
thinking about the subject matter. A list of suggested books is attached. If
you want to pick one outside of this list, you must get an okay from the
instructor regarding its appropriateness before you start working on it. ****

_Grading criteria_ : The review may be roughly divided into two segments. The
first part should be a summary of the book (5-6 pages, 8 grade points).
Articulate the core ideas of the book in this section. The second segment
should be your _reaction_ to the core themes of the book (5-6 pages, 7 grade
points). Critique the book keeping group dynamics and small groups as the
focus. What did you learn from the book that will help you in this regard?

**Due: November 20**  
2\. **Personal Application Essays** (PAE)  
Based on your experience of the group dynamics as well as readings and
concepts discussed in class you will submit **two** analyses known as _PAE_ s.
Personal Application Essays (PAE) are assignments that integrate theory and
practice. Following Kolb's (1984) _experiential learning cycle_ , a PAE will
have four components: _concrete experience_ (CE), _reflective observation_
(RO), _abstract conceptualization_ (AC), and _active experimentation_ (AE).
The CE is a detailed description of your experiences during the class
interaction. In RO, you reflect on the experience from different perspectives.
AC is the place to theorize or conceptualize the experience based on readings
and concepts discussed in class. AE is your opportunity to suggest what you
will do differently in a similar situation in the future. In other words, you
not only describe and reflect on the experiences, but also seek to explain and
make sense of them in order to experiment with new learning and action plans.

The PAEs should be about twenty to twenty-five double spaced pages. Detailed
guidelines about writing PAEs will be given in class.

**Due: September 28 & October 30**  
  
3\. **Attendance and Participation**  
Experiential learning requires that class participants form into a learning
community and be actively involved throughout the course. Members are willing
to engage with one another because of a conviction that learning is ultimately
a social process. Members also feel a sense of ownership and responsibility
for managing their own learning while facilitating others' learning as well.  
  
The expectation is that each of you will take an active part in class
interactions. **Full attendance at all classes is required.** Because of the
condensed nature of the class schedule and because experiential learning
constitutes the entire course, missing sessions will significantly affect your
ability to benefit from this course. In addition, you will be severely limited
in your ability to write the assignments since they (except the book-review)
are based on your experiences in class interactions.

**Evaluation:**

The distribution of points will be as follows:

1\. Book review 15%  
  
2\. Analysis of group experiences (PAE) (two) 60%  
  
3\. Attendance and participation 25%  
  
We will use the following scale to determine the grade out of the total 100
points.

94 -100 = A

90 - 93.99 = A-

86 - 89.99 = B+

80 - 85.99 = B

70 - 79.99 = C

69.99 or below = F

Late submissions, in rare events, should be negotiated before due dates.
Because of the "here and now" focus of the class design, you will lose points
for missing classes.

**LRNG 602 FALL 2001**  
**Group Dynamics and Team Learning**  
**Personal application essay (PAE) checklist**

  
  
  
  
**Instructions: Please circle appropriate choices and attach to your PAE**  
  
**Concrete Experience:** **(6 points)**  
  
， Does the paper contain an _objective,_ thorough description of what happened
/ is happening in my group?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Does the paper contain a _subjective_ description of my feelings,
perceptions and thoughts regarding what happened / is happening in my group?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
1) Not writing about your feelings  
2) Skipping important details  
3) Writing too much about others and little about self  
  
  
**Reflective Observation:** **(6 points)**  
  
， Did I look at the group experience(s) from different points view?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Did I write about the role I played and its impact on the outcomes of the
group dynamics (for example, was I an active, serious participant OR a
passive, hesitant member)?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
， Do the different perspectives add significant meaning to my understanding of
group dynamics and will that be evident to the reader?  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Have I chosen five themes to explore further in AC and AE? Yes/No  
  
What are they? List them here.  
  
1.-----------------, 2.-------------------, 3.-------------------,
4.---------------, 5.-----------------.  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
  
1) Not having multiple perspectives (That is, just listing one perspective
only which is your personal reflection)  
  
2) Not listing the five themes  
  
3) Reflecting more on others' behavior and less on self  
  
  
  
  
**Abstract Conceptualization:** **(12 points)**  
  
， Did I relate concepts from assigned readings (texts) to the group
experience?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， In relating concepts/ readings to the experience, have I described what the
readings are, or what they signify, instead of merely mentioning the concept,
author, or a book?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， In trying to make sense of the experiences, have I used concepts/ readings
from all four texts and assigned readings (if any) instead of just one source?  
  
Used all four texts Used three Used two Used one Used none  
  
  
， Did I conceptualize all five themes? Yes/No  
  
  
， Did I devote equal attention to all themse? Yes/No  
  
  
， Have I listed them in theory or statement form? Yes/No  
  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
  
1) Not elaborating on reading  
  
2) Just listing readings only instead of describing them  
  
3) Having AC based on themes that were not discussed in RO  
  
4) Simply elaborating on readings without saying how they apply. For example,
someone writes a whole page on norms (readings) but doesn't say how it applies
to the experience.  
  
  
Please note that this segment carries 12 out of the 30 points allotted to the
PAE. You must use readings extensively to do well in this section. Use
Forsyth, Stone, Seashore, Schein and any other readings you find relevant. It
is not enough to mention readings. Explain what the readings are and show how
they apply to your experience. In the past, most students who did not get an
"A" for this PAE had this section not written up well.  
  
  
**Active Experimentation:** **(6 points)**  
  
， Did I describe possible action(s) that would improve my effectiveness in the
future in a situation (e.g., project teams) like this?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Did I describe the generalizations I can make from what I have learned from
this experience to my work situation?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Are my A.E. plans described specifically, thoroughly, and in detail?

To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Did I write at least one AE about each of the five themes I had discussed in
RO and AC section? Yes/No  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
1) Not having AE for each theme that was developed in RO and AC  
  
2) AE looks more like an intention statement rather than an action plan.
Doesn't state specifically the action element  
  
3) Coming up with AE statements that are not linked to the CE-RO-AC flow  
  
**Difference between PAE 1 and 2:**  
1\. The first PAE is about the first twenty hours. The second PAE may cover
the last 20 hours, or the entire 40 hours.  
  
2\. As far as possible, use different themes in PAE 2. If you must use the
same theme in PAE 2 as in the first one, you should have new insights on them
to justify using them again. Also, the readings will have to be different.

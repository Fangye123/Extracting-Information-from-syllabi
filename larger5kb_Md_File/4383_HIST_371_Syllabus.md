**Jews and Judaism in Antiquity II: 1st through 7th Centuries**

Tu/Th 11-12:15, 0125 Key

This course examines the history of the Jews and of Judaism from the revolts
that ended the semi-autonomous Judaean state in Palestine between 66 and 135
CE and Arab conquests of the seventh century. Although we will begin our
discussion with various aspects of the political history of the Jews, our
primary focus will be on the social and cultural history of Jews and Judaism:
how Jews lived, how they organized their lives and their communities, and the
boundaries between Jewish and non-Jewish groups in antiquity.

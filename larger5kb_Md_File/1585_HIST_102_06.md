weight of the missed examination will be added to the final examination. The
final grade will be composed of:

1/4 two section tests. These tests (scheduled on the course outline) will
cover material in readings and/or material covered in class.  
1/4 One final exam.  
1/2 Student journal consisting of:  
1) Five weekly typed, separate reactions to and summaries of (minimum 100
words each summary, 50 each reaction) no more than one document per week (due
first class period of that week in class; late submissions not accepted),
beginning week III through week XIV and the thesis statements of the textbook
chapters for those five weeks. Summaries should briefly include the historical
background of events and persons related to the document. Reactions should be
your response to/assessment of what the author is saying and/or proposing. On
analyzing these primary sources, see Cantor, chapter 4. Please come to class
prepared to discuss your document and chapter theses!  
2) Two separate reviews with final revisions (5+ pp. each) of the two
compilations assigned for this course. On writing reviews, see Cantor, chapter
8. Reviews should include:  
1\. identification of the editor, the authors and their qualifications for
this publication,  
2\. the thesis (conclusion of research, not the topic or subject) of the
authors,  
3\. an explanation for why the editor selected the historians used,  
4\. your assessment of the authors' motives,  
5\. how the compilation is successful, unsuccessful, and could have been more
successful?

opinions?  
Complete journals are due April 22-24 for submission and final grading. Please
keep hard copies of any work submitted for the course. This is your
responsibility. You are also responsible for timely submission of any work
due; therefore, do not depend on computer or technical systems to function at
the last minute. Computer disks or e-mail submissions/enclosures are
unacceptable because of the possibility of computer viruses. If you cannot
submit on time work for one week, choose another week.

permitted without prior approval of the instructor and that usually only for
medical cause. Students disrupting class are subject to removal.

**Note: An up-to-date, online version of the course syllabus is maintained
at<http://www.oberlin.edu/history/GJK/H323S02>.**

  
This course explores the cultural dynamics, social relations, and political
structures that shaped the lives of ordinary Americans -- black and white,
male and female, rich and poor, urban and rural, native born and immigrant,
Indian and other -- between approximately 1820 and 1850. Emphasis will be
placed on current scholarly debates and different approaches to historical
analysis. Student participation in class discussions (both online and face-to-
face) is essential to the success of the course.  
  
---  
**Format:** The class meets regularly on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:30 to
2:45 p.m. Class attendance is mandatory, participation in class discussions is
expected, and students are also required to post a question or comment on
Blackboard in advance of designated class sessions. In addition to regular
class meetings, we will take a trip to [Hale Farm and
Village](http://www.wrhs.org/sites/hale.htm) in Bath, Ohio, at a mutually
agreed upon time.  
**Evaluation:** Students will be graded on the basis of class participation
and two analytical essays (8-10 pages each). The basic formula is 1/3 for
class participation (including postings on Blackboard), 1/3 for the first
essay, and 1/3 for the second essay. The professor reserves the right to
exercise some discretion in assigning final grades.  
**Honor Code:** All course work is governed by Oberlin's [Honor
Code](http://www.oberlin.edu/%7Estlife/r_r/honor.html). If you have a question
about how the Honor Code applies to a particular assignment, you should ask
the professor in advance of the due date.  
  
**Purchases:** The following books are available for purchase at the Oberlin
Bookstore. Most are also on reserve at Mudd, but the professor strongly
encourages you to acquire your own copies.

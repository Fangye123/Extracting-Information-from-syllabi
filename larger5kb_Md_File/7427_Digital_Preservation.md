###  Purpose:

There are two different, yet related, foci of this course: digitally-born and
digitally reformatted materials. Students will look at the problems, issues,
and decision-making processes surrounding the preservation of digital
information including mainframe, WAN, LAN, and personal computer based
documents in offices as well as web-based information. The primary emphasis on
the course will be on the issues surrounding the digitization of materials for
preservation.

Digitally-born electronic records are a growing concern for archivist and
records managers, these issues are treated in more depth in other courses, but
will be touched on briefly in this class. Digitally-reformatted collections
will be examined through a number of different lenses. How they relate to
books, serials, archival collections, and image collections will be examined
as well as some of the overarching issues such as copyright, economics, and
long term sustainability of these collections will be discussed. The class
will also contain hands-on exercises and imaging.

###  Course Requirements:

Students will be expected to be able to participate in class discussions of
reading assignments. The class will combine seminar and lecture formats. In
addition to active class participation and mandatory class attendance,
students will be expected to complete three other assignments. Failure to
complete any of these three assignments will result in a failing grade in the
course. Spelling errors and grammatical mistakes detrimentally affect the
project grade. No late assignments will be accepted without prior written
permission. All late assignments will be marked down.

### Accommodations

Students with disabilities who require special testing accommodations or other
classroom modifications should notify the instructor and the office of
Disability Resources & Services (DRS) no later than the 3rd week of the term.
Students may be asked to provide documentation of their disability to
determine the appropriateness of the request. DRS is located in 216 William
Pitt Union and can be contacted at 648-7890 (Voice), 624-3346(Fax), and
383-7355(TTY). Students who must miss an exam or class due to religious
observance must notify the instructor ahead of time and make alternative
arrangements.

### Assignments

The assignments will be:  Due Date | Assignment | Percent of Grade  
---|---|---  
**February 14** |  A team (2 people) exercise involving the identification of
benchmarking attributes, calculation of various benchmarking formulas, imaging
of a set of documents, and determination of appropriate display criteria.
[Assignment Description](digpresassign1.html) | 20%  
**February 21** |  Topic proposal for final paper |  
**March 14** |  A paper examining selection criteria: its history, problems,
and challenges for digital preservation See [Description | 20%  
**April 18** |  Final Paper. A case study of a project with a digital
preservation component or a research paper on a methodology for digital
preservation. See my [Bibliography for the Educause
Conference](:bibliography.html") for lists of digital projects and other
resources. [More about the paper requirements](digpresfinal.html) | 40%

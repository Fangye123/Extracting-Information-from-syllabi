**Study sheet for the first test.**  
  
This section of the international relations course emphasizes the
modernization process as it worked in Europe/North America and as it is
working in the so-called Third World. Samuel Huntington's _Political Order in
Changing Societies_ is a comprehensive approach to political modernization
which speaks to beginner and expert alike. The original insights in the book
and its wide usage mean that time spent with this book will prove useful now
and in the future. The Goldstein text talks about the Third World view of
international relations and economic issues which will be important to
international relations during your lifetime. Hughes identifies the current
thinking among system-oriented international relations experts.

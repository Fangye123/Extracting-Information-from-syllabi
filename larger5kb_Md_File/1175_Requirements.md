After each exam, students will receive a **Student Grade Report** detailing
grades received, attendance, and participation. Students with questions about
anything on their Report should discuss them with the instructor.

**Incompletes** are granted only if the student is unable to complete specific
course requirements for reasons beyond his or her control. Incompletes are
granted only if the student contacts the instructor before the end of the
term, and then only if the instructor agrees that the circumstances merit an
incomplete. The student and the instructor must complete an Incomplete Grade
Form.

####  Course Policies

**Late Work**

Students are responsible for all work assigned in this class, whether or not
they are present. Assignments must be completed on time. **Late work** will be
penalized one letter grade unless you have a good excuse, and no assignments
will be accepted more than one week late.   No late work will be accepted
after June 19.

**Make-ups** for missed examinations and quizzes are given at the discretion
of the instructor. The absence must be excused under the same conditions as
absence from class (see Attendance). In general, make-ups must be taken within
one week of the original date of the exam. Any make-up work for absences not
justified by written evidence will be treated as late work and penalized one
letter grade.

**Attendance**

Attendance is required. **Excessive absence** (more than 1 unexcused absence)
can affect the participation grade.   Failure to complete a Discussion List
assignment by the due date constitutes tardiness; failure to complete it
within one week of the due date constitutes an absence.

**Tardiness** disrupts the class and is also discouraged. Any student arriving
after the instructor has finished calling the roll may be considered tardy,
and two incidents of unexcused tardiness count as one unexcused absence.
Students who arrive late should check with the instructor at the end of class
to make sure they are not marked absent.

If the instructor uses a **seating chart** , students are required to sit in
their assigned seats unless given permission to sit elsewhere. Failure to sit
in one's assigned seat may cause the instructor to mark the student absent.

Students are expected to remain in class until they are dismissed, unless they
have received prior permission from the instructor to leave early. **Early
departure** from class will be treated the same as tardiness--two such
occurrences will constitute an unexcused absence.

**Excuses** for tardiness and absence will be accepted at the discretion of
the instructor. Written documentation may be required, especially for lengthy
or repeated problems. Students should bring excuses to the instructor's
attention as soon as possible--before the event if it is foreseeable,
immediately after if not. Excuses for tardiness should be discussed with the
instructor immediately after the class for which the student is tardy; excuses
for absence should be discussed the first day the student returns to class.
With rare exceptions, **excuses will not be accepted after these dates**.

Students may make up **one** unexcused absence or **two** unexcused
tardinesses by writing a report on the material covered during the missed
class. The report must be typed, 2-3 pages long (500-750 words).

**Participation**

All students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the assigned
material. This implies that students should read the material before class.
Perfect comprehension is not expected at the beginning of class, but students
should be familiar with the topic and the major points, and they should have
identified areas they do not understand well enough to ask focused,
intelligent questions about them. The instructor reserves the right to give
unannounced quizzes or other assignments to check students' preparation.

There are several ways students can participate:

  1. by asking and answering questions in class, 
  2. by contributing to their team, 
  3. by discussing course material with the instructor during office hours, 
  4. by contributing through e-mail or discussion lists to the class.

Students are expected to observe normal courtesy in class. They are expected
to pay attention to the instructor, to take detailed notes, to refrain from
personal conversation, and to avoid any other behavior that disturbs others. A
student who does not observe these courtesies may be asked to leave the room.

**Academic Honesty**

Students should be aware that a university is a community of scholars
committed to the discovery and dissemination of knowledge and truth. Without
freedom to investigate all materials, scrupulous honesty in reporting
findings, and proper acknowledgment of credit, such a community can not
survive. Students are expected to adhere to the highest traditions of
scholarship. Infractions of these traditions, such as plagiarism (cheating),
are not tolerated. Misrepresenting someone else's words or ideas as one's own
constitutes plagiarism. In cases where plagiarism occurs, the instructor has
the right to penalize the student(s) as he or she thinks appropriate. The
first offence results in failure of the assignment, the second offence in
failure of the course. Students who wish to contest a finding of academic
dishonesty may invoke the process outlined in the FSU Student Handbook.

Team assignments require a special note. Each member of the study team is
expected to contribute to the assignment. Every member of the team gets the
same grade for the assignment. A student who does not contribute is
essentially misrepresenting someone else's words and ideas as one's own. This
is academic dishonesty, and it will be treated as such.

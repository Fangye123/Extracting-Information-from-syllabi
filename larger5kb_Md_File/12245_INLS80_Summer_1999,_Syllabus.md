Evaluation  
  


_Course Catalog Description:_ INLS80 Data Communication (3 hours). Examines
the functions of data communication networks, such as the Internet, for
communication, accessing remote resources, and information searching and
retrieval. Explores emerging multimedia applications and their potential uses.
Note: This is an undergraduate level course, intended primarily for students
pursuing their minor in information science.

_Pre-requisite:_ INLS50 or comparable skills, including the ability to send
and receive email, the use of microcomputer software such as word processors,
and the use of Web browsers.  

  
_Course Objectives:_ INLS80 gives broad knowledge of data communication
systems, with a focus on Internet tools and applications. Goals include:

  * Gaining hands-on experience with modern tools for Internet-based communication.
  * Developing an informed approach to historical and future trends in networked computing. 
  * Demonstrating fundamental skills for instruction, diagnosis, support, analysis and management in diverse computing environments. 

_Computer Use:_ In order to meet the course objectives, it is necessary to use
networked computing resources **r e g u l a r l y** to practice skills.
Students **m u s t** login to the class computing resource (called 'ruby') or
an alternate Internetworked computer daily in order to be successful. Regular
access and use of the Internet is required for this course, and may be
obtained at home or work via dial-in modem, in computing laboratories at UNC
or elsewhere, or by other means.

_Evaluation:_ All assigned work must be completed in order to receive a
passing grade in INLS80. Late work is downgraded at a rate of 1 point per
business day. Unless otherwise discussed in class, all work is to be added to
your online Web-based portfolio for evaluation and is due by 9:45 am on the
due date. Instructions for doing this will be given in class. Througout the
semester, you will be able to create more and more sophisticated presentations
of your work.

_Assignments& Grading:_ You will be graded on three assignments (30% total,
10% each), a mid-term exam (25%) and a final project (35%). Class
participation (10%) will also count towards your final grade. The assignments
are as follows:

  1. Internet Explorations : Three written assignments dealing with different aspects of Internet communication resources. Details and examples of the scope and purpose of these reviews will be discussed in class. 

> Beyond the review content, each review should include:

      * A title; good organization; effective use of English 
      * Identification of the review's intended audience 
      * Identification of the resource's intended audience 

>  

All reviews will be authored as HTML documents and will be available for
perusal by your classmates. A formula for making the reviews available will be
discussed in class. Each is graded on a scale of 0 to 10 points, with 8 being
'good.' Together, the reviews compose 30% of your course grade.

Due Date | Resource Type | Review Type  
---|---|---  
June 1st |  [Online Literature](a1.html) | Report and analysis  
June 11th | [Search Engines](a2.html) | Comparison and recommendation  
June 16th | [Mailing list or Newsgroup](a4.html) | Ethnography  
  


  2. Exam. Thursday, **June 3**. Test of knowledge and judgement about data communication systems and software.   
Counts as 25% of your course grade. (Note: there is no final exam for INLS80)

  3. Term project. Choose one of the following types of projects, or propose an alternate. You may elect to complete your project in a group with up to 3 other students in the class.  A one-page proposal for your term project is due on **May 28**. The final project is due on **June 18th at 5.00pm**. Counts as 35% of your course grade. 

      * Create a substantial "webliography" on a chosen topic using HTML and related tools. The number of resources included will depend on the extensiveness of the content you develop: A series of hypertext links to network-wide resources with only brief reviews might have over 100 resources, while a collection of extensive multi-paragraph reviews with introductory and summative content might only include 30. The webliography must include a clear statement of purpose and audience, be well-organized, and provide proper attribution for any secondary resources used. 
      * Author a series of web pages for a particular organization, including various types of multimedia in your design. The initial requirements for the page, as well as any feedback from the organization, should be included somewhere in your final pages. 

  
For either project, follow good HTML/Web design principles and use the
appropriate <META> tags (we'll go over these in class). If you choose to work
in groups, you will be asked to submit a brief paragraph or two on the
contributions of the various group members

The proposal should be a brief summary of what you are planning on doing for
your final project. The specific items included in your proposal will vary
based on which type of project you choose to complete. If you are doing a web
page for an organization include information about that organization and any
resources that are already available, some of the additional resources you
will be including in your project, and information about your contact person
at the organization. Questions to answer might include: Do they have a web
site currently? What type of audience will view these web pages? If you are
creating a "webliography" outline your chosen topic and give an indication of
the type of resources you will include.

Final Project presentations will be no longer than 10 minutes in length.
Presentations of your web pages should include background information about
your site and why you created it, a basic "tour" of your web pages, and a
discussion of any difficulties you ran into.

In addition to the project itself (the web pages you've created), you will
submit documentation. This can be linked to from your web project, or it can
be emailed to me separately, but all of this is due by **June 18th at
5.00pm**. Late work will absolutely, positively, NOT be accepted. Early work
is encouraged!

The supporting documentation should consist of:

    1. a site map, diagram or index
    2. documentation of your design decisions and your justifications for these decisions 
    3. documentation of the tools you used to create your pages (e.g., HTML editors, hand coded, Photoshop, etc.)
    4. a description of your target audience for these web pages and the purpose of your web site
    5. a discussion of any major problems you ran into and what you did to get around these problems
    6. what are the strengths and weaknesses of your site?
    7. documentation should include anything that you think is relevant or special. If I can't see it, or am not aware of it, then it won't be graded
    8. Group projects only--if you are doing a group project, turn in an evaluation of each team member's contributions to the project (email this to me separately \- don't put this on your web page) - include who did what and an evaluation of the effort put forth by each team member. This will be completed confidentially.   

  

  4. Preparedness and involvement. Your level of participation and preparedness in class discussions, lab exercises and class electronic forums. Counts as 10% of your course grade.

_Text_ : There is a required text for the course. You may elect to choose
supplemental readings from alternate texts. There are many books related to
the course subject matter, most of which cover similar topics. The text was
chosen for their subject matter and style of delivery, recent publication
date, publication quality, and price. Other readings may be placed on reserve
in the Undergraduate Library and announced in class. Read the assigned
readings before the class date they are assigned for, and review as necessary
afterwards.

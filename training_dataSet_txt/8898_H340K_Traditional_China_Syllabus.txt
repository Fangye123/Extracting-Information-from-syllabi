Description: 
This course offers a cultural history of traditional China from some of the earliest historical records (about 1200 B.C.) up through the late imperial period (about 1800 A.D.). We will cover the major historical events, developments, and trends -- social, political, economic, military, philosophical, literary, and cultural. The main focus of the course will be on primary sources. We will read (in translation) the most important writings from the Chinese tradition. These include Shang dynasty oracle bone inscriptions (used for divination), early Chinese philosophy (including Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism), dynastic histories, historical biographies, novels, satires, poetry, songs, ritual manuals, diaries, scientific treatises, philological studies, and political debates. We will take an interdisciplinary approach, integrating history with literary studies, philosophy, and anthropology, in order to better understand these texts in their historical context. 
Grading:
The grade will be based on in-class quizzes and class participation (30%), mid-term and final examinations (30%), and a final paper (40%) (or two written essays -- 20% each, 40% total).

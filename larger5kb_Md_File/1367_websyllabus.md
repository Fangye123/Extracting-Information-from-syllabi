>>>> **Introduction:**

>>>>

>>>> Writing a utopia involves an effort to imagine the best conceivable
society. Utopias aim partly to criticize the existing order and partly to
determine which social arrangements might constitute genuine improvements to
the existing social order **.** In this course, we will explore European ideas
of Utopias, with a concentration upon the early modern era (1450-1600)

>>>>

>>>> In the first part of the course, we will first attempt to discern what
the main components of utopias (and dystopias or anti-utopias) are, and then
read and discuss pairs of ideal societies. Works by Plato and Sir Thomas More;
Montaigne and Kirkpatrick Sales; Francis Bacon and Carolyn Merchant, as well
as Thomas Hobbes and Christopher Hill will be compared and contrasted to
elucidate characteristics of Renaissance Humanism, New World Exploration, the
Scientific Revolution, and the rise of absolutism vs. republican sovereignty.
Therefore, we will examine these utopias and analyses of utopias critically,
analyzing what they tell us about the intellectual, political, and cultural
history of early modern society **.**

>>>>

>>>> Along the way, we will also be looking at the potential of utopias to be
used as primary sources in a historical argument. This brings us to the second
part of the course, in which you will prepare and present to the class a major
research paper (20 pages in length) using primary and secondary sources. This
course is a required capstone class for senior history majors, designed to
give you the experience of real historical research.

>>>>

>>>> For your paper, you may choose a topic about early modern utopias OR more
modern utopian communities. Hence, if you are primarily interested in American
history, you may write about the Shakers, or the utopian views of society
presented at the World Fairs in the twentieth century, or any other relevant
topic about ideal societies. Or, if you want to understand the Enlightenment
more thoroughly, you may write a paper that contrasts utopian elements in
Voltaire's _Candide_ and/or Rousseau's _Social Contract_. However, the topic
and approach are up to you; throughout the course, I will help you formulate
and refine your topic and argument, as well as having the subject specialist
in the UMD library give a presentation about how to best use library
resources. By the end of the course, you will have been given a taste of doing
professional historical research, as well as have a better understanding of
early modern European ideal and real societie s.

> **Course Requirements** **and Grading**

>>>>

>>>> The following assignments are required:

>>>>

>>>> 1\. **Short response papers (3 pages or so)** during the course of the
semester. These papers are designed to help you synthesize your thoughts about
the reading and prepare for class discussion. I will hand out suggested
questions for these papers each class session, and you must choose THREE
papers to write. **These papers are worth 25% of your grade, and must be typed
and double-spaced**.

>>>>

>>>> **2\. Oral Presentations:** Throughout the course of the semester, you
will be asked to do one oral report on a reading concerning the discussion
topic for that week, and to help lead the discussion. The report must be 10
minutes long, followed by discussion. **This is worth 5% of your grade**

>>>>

>>>> **3\. Class Participation** : This is a seminar, which means coming to
class prepared, with your reading finished, is essential to your success in
this course. I consider attendance mandatory, unless in the case of illness or
emergency, and I will penalize absences. You must also come prepared to
discuss the readings; lack of participation will affect your grade
significantly. **Participation is worth 15% of your grade.**

>>>>

>>>> 4\. **Meeting with Dr. Roos** and preliminary report about your paper.
For either March 23 rd or April 13th's class session (oba), you must make a
scheduled appointment with Dr. Roos about your paper topic and bring with you
a preliminary report. The preliminary report is 1-2 pages, and states your
topic, possible thesis statement, and your list of sources. **The report and
meeting are worth 5% of your grade.**

>>>>

>>>> 5\. **The major seminar paper and presentation** : This paper must be at
least 20 pages, typed, double-spaced, with footnotes/endnotes and
bibliography. I am going to ask you to use Turabian/University of Chicago
style. [See this link to a
styleguide](http://www.uwlax.edu/LS/History/turabian.html).

>>>>

>>>> The paper must be about a utopia in history, and it must advance a
historical argument. In other words, you must make a claim, and support that
claim with both primary and secondary source material. Mere narratives are not
acceptable. I am also asking you to make a 15-20 minute presentation, with
question and answer session afterwards about your paper. You must not just
read your paper, but make a _presentation_ , complete with at least one-two
visual aids/sound recordings, etc. Multimedia presentations
(slides/music/websites) are highly encouraged. **The paper is worth 40% of
your grade, and the presentation 10%.**

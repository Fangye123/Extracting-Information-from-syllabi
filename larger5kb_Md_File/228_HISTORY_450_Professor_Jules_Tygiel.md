_ **COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING** :

The final grade will be determined by the results of four papers based on the
course readings (50%), an internet research assignment (30%) and class
participation and attendance (20%). All papers and exams are to be word
processed and double-spaced. Instructions for the papers and research papers
will be distributed separately. Papers are due on February 22, March 16, April
25, and May 23. Research papers are due on the final day of class (May 18).
All research papers submitted by May 4 will receive a bonus of one-third of a
grade.

Class discussions are an important part of the course. All students are
expected to have finished the reading assignments before each class session
and should be prepared to answer questions and discuss the material at all
sessions. Attendance will be graded as follows: 3 or fewer absences (A); 4-6
absences (B); 7-9 absences (C); 10-12 absences (D); more than 12 absences (F).
There are no excused absences.

#### INTERNET AND MULTIMEDIA

This course will use resources on the Internet and other types of media
(videos, cd-roms) to enhance our understanding of the years between 1916 and
1945. The course will be taught in a "smart classroom," giving us in-room
access to the Internet and videos. The online version of this syllabus
contains many links to various primary sources from this era: photographs,
movies, speeches, songs, advertisements, radio broadcasts, and documents. In
addition we will watch film clips from several videos that are not available
on the Internet. We will use these materials during the class sessions to give
us a sense of what life was like during these years and to stimulate our class
discussions. Students will also be able to access these sources via the
Internet when studying at home or writing papers. Be forewarned, however, that
since these links contain photo, movie and sound elements, they work best with
a high-speed connection. Those with slower connections, must have patience.



The following students in my Fall, 1999 History 660 course assisted in
creating this interactive experiment: John Dobbs, Sandra Henderson, Michael
Sheehan, Patrick Taylor, Marco Vincenti, John Williams.   I am also grateful
to Andrew Roderick for his invaluable assistance.  I have relied heavily on
resources that are already available on the Internet and **I am deeply
indebted to the individuals and institutions that have made these materials
available.** I have tried to acknowledge the source of these materials
wherever possible.

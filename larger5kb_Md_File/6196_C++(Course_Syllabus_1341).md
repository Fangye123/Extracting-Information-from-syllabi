**PREREQUISITE:** | **An introductory programming course**  
  
* * *

|

* * *  
  
**CATALOG DESCRIPTION:** | **Introduction to the fundamental concepts of
computer science--algorithms, program structures, data structures.
Structured programming in C++.  Development of programming skills to solve
problems of reasonable complexity.   Introduction to UNIX.**

**TEXTBOOK:** | **STARTING OUT WITH C++, Tony Gaddis,   Scott/Jones Publisher,
edition 2, 1999.**

* * *  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:** | **There will be regularly assigned homework
problems. Some of these will be exercises from the required texts. Others will
be programming projects which will require the students to spend time in the
computer laboratory.  
  
Note: To plan a minimum of three hours of outside preparation for each hour of
class is a safe time allocation for successfully completing the course.  
  
Due date for all assigned materials will be announced in advance. It is the
student's responsibility to have all assignments ready on time. Any student
who has to be absent on an assignment due date must arrange to have the
assignment submitted early. Late assignments may not be accepted.**  
  
* * *

**METHOD OF PRESENTATION:** | **Class lectures will cover the assigned reading
material. Selected sample programs and assigned homework/ programs will be
discussed in class.**  
  
* * *

|

* * *  
  
**METHOD OF EVALUATION:** | **There will be three major exams and the final
during the semester. Points will be awarded for tests, homework, quizzes, and
programs as described below.

>   * Test #1 = 125

>   * Test #2 = 125

>   * Test #3 = 125

>

>   * Pop Quizzes = 15 each  
>

>   * Homework = 10 each  
>

>   * Programs = 30 each  
>

> **

>   * **IT Labs = 40 points  
>

>   * Class/Lab participation = 50 points  
>

>   * Final exam = 200  
>

>

Final grades will be determined by a curve based on the number of points each
student receives during the semester.  Written homework assignments will NOT
be accepted late. Your lowest homework grade will be dropped.  Programs can be
turned in 48   hours late with permission from your instructor  but will lose
10 points. A separate late folder for submission will have to be requested.
Programs that output incorrect answers for the given data set will receive
zero points and no other opportunity will be given to correct your errors.
Students are encouraged to carefully check the output from their programs
before turning them in.  
  
Quizzes missed cannot be made up under ANY circumstances. The lowest quiz
grade is dropped.  
  
There are NO makeup exams unless your instructor has been presented and has
approved a valid, documented excuse PRIOR to the exam. Missing an exam,
otherwise, will result in a grade of a zero.  
  
Final grades determined as follows:  
90-100  A  
87-89   B+     80-86   B  
77-79   C+     70-76   C  
67-69   D+     60-66   D  
    below 60 F**

**ATTENDANCE POLICY:** | **Students are expected to attend all class lectures.
If a student is absent from class on the due date of any assignment, they are
expected to make alternative arrangements to assure that the assignment is
turned in on time.**  
  
* * *

**ACADEMIC ETHICS:** | **You are expected to create, edit and print out YOUR
OWN assignments and take tests without outside assistance. All work is
expected to be your own. Students are NOT to work together on the writing of
programs or the doing of homework.   That is considered scholastic dishonesty
in this class. For first offense, zeroes will be given to all parties
involved; any further offense results in an automatic grade of an F in this
course, and a report will be filed with the Honor Council.  The  Computer
Science Department Head  will be notified for indication on your permanent
record.  All further correspondence will be done through that office.
THEREFORE, it is imperative if you need help on your assignments that you
contact your instructor or TA.**

**Disability Accommodations:** | **If you need academic accommodations for a
disability, you must first contact Ms. Rebecca Marin, Coordinator, Services
for Students with Disabilities(214-768-4563) to verify the disability and to
establish eligibility for accommodations.   Then you should schedule an
appointment with the professor to make appropriate arrangements.**

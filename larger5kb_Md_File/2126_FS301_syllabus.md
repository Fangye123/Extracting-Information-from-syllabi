**  
COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
   The study of ethics and politics often focuses on "big moral moments" (such
as abortion) or electoral politics and governmental policy (who is going to
win, and what kind of laws will they pass). This class considers the
importance of the ethics and politics of everyday life in the contemporary
United States. The decisions we make about how to live, what to eat, what to
buy, how to transport ourselves, which media to watch and read, and which
technologies to use have ethical and political dimensions. The course aims to
make visible those dimensions of everyday life, but not with the goal of
determining a moral code or politics that can be uniformly imposed. Instead,
my hope is that by highlighting these aspects of our lives and helping people
engage in conversation and deliberation about the issues, the possibility of
progressive social change can be enhanced. In addition to looking at the
specific issues, the course will focus on the role of personal choices in
collective life and social change.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
**   This is a seminar course, which means you are responsible for comingto
class ready to participate in the creation of knowledge (that's right--
we'regoing to create knowledge). Here's a quick summary of how that will
work:We will read five books. You will write five papers about your reaction
tothose books. We will meet once a week to talk. No exams.  
  Your grade will be based equally on your writing and your talking. Here's
the formula:  
  1\. five reaction papers, 10 points each:  50 points  
  2\. participation in class discussion:         50 points  
  
  1\. Reaction papers:  
  At the beginning of the classes marked on the schedule, you willturn in a
3-5 page paper (typed, double-spaced) in which you react to thebook being
discussed that week. You should have read the entire book by thatclass period.  
  By "reaction paper," I mean an essay in which you reflect on what you
consider to be the main thesis or theses of the author. The goal is not simply
a report; I don't want you to summarize the book. However, to write an
effective reaction paper you must, obviously, understand the book
andcommunicate that understanding. The goal is to move on to engage and
evaluatethe main ideas. It's not enough to say, "I really liked the
bookbecause it was interesting." Explain what was interesting and why.Evaluate
the quality of the argument the author is making.  
  So, I'm looking for a critique of the book. Critique is not a solely
negative enterprise and is not synonymous with complaining, whining, or mean-
spiritedness. To critique a book, thesis, or argument is to examine it to
determine its nature so that we can understand its possibilities and
limitations. Critique can result in criticism, which sometimes can be
justifiably harsh. But critique also can reveal the strength of an argument.
Critique is a thoughtful enterprise, the goal of which is to deepen our
understanding of an issue or problem.  
  Some of the questions you might ask yourself as you are reading and
organizing your thoughts: What assumptions guide the author? What political,
social, or theological systems does the author seem, directly or indirectly,
to be endorsing? What evidence does the author offer in support of her/his
conclusions? Is the logic of the arguments sound? What is the goal of the
author? If the author has valid points, what would they mean for my life?  
  To answer these questions, you will have to state your own viewson relevant
subjects. You may talk about yourself or your experiences. Butthis should not
be an essay solely about you and your feelings; try to connect your
experiences to the larger questions.  
   In your reaction paper you may want to draw on evidence or argumentsfrom
other sources. That may be necessary if you want to refute a claim madeby the
author, but it is not required in every paper. If you do use informationfrom
other sources, make sure it is properly cited.  
  
   2\. Class participation:  
  Discussions will have two basic components. At the beginning of class, we
will go around the room and give each person a chance to comment about an
aspect of the book that is important to her/him. This could mean talking about
what part of the book most affected you. It could mean venting your annoyance
with something the author wrote. The goal is to give you a chance to get in
your two cents before we start the general discussion.  
  After that, I will take over as discussion leader and ask questions about
the book. Some of those questions will be thrown out to the entireclass. Some
will be posed to specific people. I will assume that everyonehas read the
entire book and is prepared to respond. So, come to class preparedto speak
coherently about a particular aspect of the book that is importantto you and
to respond to questions that are important to me.  
  At the end of the semester I will judge your overall contribution to class
discussion. This portion of your grade will be based on your: (a) familiarity
with readings; (b) ability to hear and understand what others say; (c) ability
to express yourself clearly; (d) ability to synthesize the thoughts of others
to form new insights, conclusions, or questions; (e) ability to disagree
constructively; and (f) cooperation in building a stimulating and supportive
intellectual atmosphere in class.  
  Because half your grade is based on class participation, it is obvious that
attendance is crucial; you can't participate if you aren't there. Iwill handle
folks who miss class on a case-by-case basis. If you have tomiss a class and
have a good excuse, let me know as soon as possible.

SYLLABUS
INTRODUCTION: HIS 371 / 571, History
of Japan, undertakes a chronological survey of political, economic,
social, cultural, religious and intellectual life in Japan from the third
century to the present day. Emphasis is placed on both the origin and development
of traditional Japanese civilization before the arrival of the modernizing
West and the subsequent Japanese quest for international acceptance thereafter.
The course has been purposefully designed
to provide a background against which contemporary Japan might be better
understood and appreciated. Course content stresses the origin and development
of various systems and institutions (social, political, economic and religious)
within both the traditional and modern Japanese cultural milieu. The modernization
process, the Westernization process and the fate of traditional institutions,
systems and customs will be explored in depth. Strong consideration will
also be given Japan's quest for acceptance as a major power on the modern
international scene and the impact of change on both individuals and groups
within Japanese society.
The following is a list of major course
objectives for HIS 373 / 573: at the end of fifteen weeks of instruction,
students enrolled in HIS 371 / 571, History of Japan should be able
to --



identify basic terms, personalities and
concepts associated with the study of Japanese history and explain their
historical significance;

identify and locate important items of
geographical information and both evaluate and explain the environmental
impact on the historical development of traditional Japanese culture;

given an interpretive question regarding
a specific period in Japanese history, demonstrate a firm grasp of the
era's historical significance;

discuss with insight and the use of supporting
evidence the developmental process behind and the basic characteristics
of social, political, economic, cultural and religious life in traditional
Japan before the arrival of the modernizing West in 1853;

assess insights into traditional Japanese
culture gained from reading various selections of traditional literature,
poetry and drama, including specifically The Confessions of Lady Nijo
and Four Major Plays of Chikamatsu;

distinguish and discuss internally generated
aspects of the modernization process present in Japanese life before 1868
and predict the Japanese reaction to the impact of Western-induced modernization
in Japan after 1854;

account for the collapse of the Tokugawa-controlled
Military - Bureaucratic state in 1868;

discuss with illustrative detail the
patterns of economic, political, social and cultural modernization emerging
in Japan after 1868, accounting in the process for the impact on these
patterns of both past Japanese traditions and the process of Westernization;

assess insights into life in modern Japan
gained from reading Natsume Soseki's Kokoro and Junichiro Tanizaki's
The Makioka Sisters;

describe and discuss the historical process
leading to Japanese involvement in World War II;

describe the effects of both war and
its aftermath, the occupation, and Japan's "economic miracle" on present
day Japanese life and institutions;

discuss aspects of Japanese life today
in historical perspective, pointing out and evaluating continuing traditional
influences and the impact of the past on modern day Japan;

utilize and evaluate visual resources
to advance comprehension and understanding of the process of Japanese cultural
development;

assess attitude shifts in personal images
associated with Japan taking place as a result of enrolling in this course.

>

> **Purpose:**  
>  History 200 is a survey-level course looking at world history between 1500
and the present. Students will explore the history of western expansion and
the varied responses of the rest of the globe to these incursions. Students
will also develop critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.

>

> **Absences, Make-ups, and Other Policies:**  
>  Students who miss class must have an excused absence, which includes ONLY
illnesses (with a doctor's note) and university business (also documented).
With regards to the latter, as soon as you know the dates for your absences,
you must let me know, and I will record these as "excused." I will then
average your grades without counting those days either way. Otherwise,
absences will hurt your grade, particularly on days during which we have
discussions of articles and books. I will begin counting off participation and
on your final grade after two absences. Three lates equals one absence, and
that includes lateness on returning from breaks. I reserve the right to count
off as much as a letter grade on your final grade for excessive absences and
lateness.

>

> I will give one make-up examination for both of the first two exams. If you
miss either the first or second test with an excused absence, I will give you
an objective test over the first two-thirds of the course. If you miss both of
the first two exams, you must drop the course. Otherwise, I will not give
make-up assignments for any reason; one cannot "make up" class participation
or in-class writing assignments. At the end of the semester, I will drop the
lowest grade on in-class assignments. Otherwise, I will give NO extra credit,
so please do not ask.

>

> All written assignments are due at the BEGINNING of class. I will take off
10 points a day for each day a paper is late. I will not accept papers later
than a week after the due date.  Incompletes will only be given in the case of
grave emergencies (approved by the dean), when a student has had to miss the
final.

>

> **Academic Dishonesty:**  
>  Anyone caught cheating in this course will be flunked for the course. All
papers should be original and written specifically for this class.
Furthermore, students may not plagiarize.

>

> Plagiarism is the act of stealing the words or ideas of another person and
passing them off as your own. The definition of plagiarism is four words in a
row. If you use four or more identical words in a row from ANY text, you must
(1) put those words in quotation marks; and (2) cite the reference in
parenthesis after the quote. For example, "he had returned from his journey
aloft" (Plato, 749). Remember: BOTH the quotation marks AND the page reference
must be present to avoid penalties for plagiarism. Close paraphrasing by
changing a word or two or the tense of the verbs is also plagiarism.

>

> If you use the IDEAS of a writer, but not his/her exact words, you should
cite the author and page without the quotation marks. However, you should
NEVER use quotation marks without citation. In other words, any time you quote
something, you must also tell the reader where the words originated.

>

> If you unintentionally plagiarize, you will be docked ten points for each
instance. If you intentionally plagiarize, you will flunk the course.

>

> Students may not collaborate on examinations or journal articles. Any
students involved in such collaboration will receive zeroes on their papers or
exams. If two students are knowingly involved, BOTH are guilty and will be
penalized accordingly.

>

> **Required Texts:**  
>  Richard M. Golden. _The Social Dimension of Western Civilization_ Vol. II.
_Readings from the Sixteenth Century to the Present_. 4 th edition.  
>  Natalie Zemon Davis.  _the Return of Martin Guerre._  
>  Jonathan Spence. _The Death of Woman Wang_.  
>  John Demos. _The Unredeemed Captive_.  
>  Chinua Achebe.   _Things Fall Apart._  
>  Mariama Ba.   So Long a Letter.

>

> There is an optional textbook. I recommend this if you have trouble
following along, difficulty taking notes, or need extra reminders or
references:  
>  Albert Craig, et.al. _The Heritage of World Civilizations_. Vol. II. _Since
1500_. 5 th edition.

>

> **Discussion Methods:**  
>  We will be discussing articles and books throughout the semester. Please
follow these guidelines in discussion:

>

> (1) The rudest thing a student can do is be late to class. It is disruptive
to everyone and harmful to discussion. Be to class on time. If you are
consistently late, I reserve the right to penalize you in your participation
grade and in your overall class grade. You will also miss the quizzes and in-
class assignments, which will hurt still more of your grade.

>

> (2) Do not speak, read, or be disruptive in any way when someone else is
speaking.

>

> (3) Please be focused. Your remarks should follow up on those of the last
speaker (either to disagree, agree, expand the point, etc.) rather than going
off on a different point.

>

> (4) Do not make personal remarks about others during discussions. I expect
students to disagree on occasion, of course, but these should be intellectual
differences only.

>

> (5) Be careful not to dominate class. You are not graded for the amount of
speaking, but the quality and appropriateness of your comments.

>

> (6) Please use gender-inclusive language (this goes as well for written
work).

>

> **Evaluation:**  
>  Three examinations (20% each); journal responses to articles (10%); in-
class assignments and quizzes (10%); group discussion leadership of
book/response grade (15%); and participation (5%). The exams will be all essay
and each will deal with one-third of the course material, and we will discuss
the format more carefully as we approach the dates of the exams. Information
about the discussion leadership can be found at the end of the syllabus.

> **DISCUSSION LEADERSHIP--INSTRUCTIONS**

>

> During the semester, students will lead discussion of the texts several
times. The instructor will pick the groups of four or five students and assign
the dates for their leadership at the beginning of the semester. Students
should try to reach the following goals for this assignment:

>

> (1) Develop discussion questions that engage the text in an analytical
manner;  
>  (2) Use the questions to further the exploration of the broader issues in
world history;  
>  (3) Connect the work with those we have read before (when applicable);  
>  (4) Engage the class with the text.

>

> Students should not talk more than five minutes about background materials;
in addition, student leaders may not ask for a mere summary of the book.
Instead, the groups should produce questions that discuss complicated issues
and themes in the text. Your grade will depend on the following criteria:

>

> (1) Ability to start a meaningful discussion, including holding students
accountable for the day's assignment;  
>  (2) Rigorous and thoughtful questions;  
>  (3) Willingness to accept other students' comments;  
>  (4) Oral communication skills (such as making eye contact, speaking clearly
and audibly, having an attractive presentation style, showing enthusiasm, and
using visual aids);  
>  (5) Coordination and smoothness in working together;  
>  (6) Creativity.

>

> Students are not limited to simply standing at the front of the classroom
and asking questions. They can develop small groups assignments, games, or
contests to get at the themes of the text and course. They can give the class
quizzes or ask for written work. The only requirement is that they engage the
class as a whole rather than giving speeches. Ten percent of the fifteen
percent of this grade will come from their leadership of their text.

>

> I do not require research for these discussion days, although you may find
it easier to ask analytical questions if you have learned more about the text.
The only written work you will need to turn in is a list of questions. This
must be a coordinated list of all three participants, not separate lists from
each person.

>

> The final five percent of the grade will come from their response to another
group's leadership. Two response groups will be chosen at random on the day
the class first discusses the text. In other words, you will not have any
warning if your group will be the one of the ones expected to respond, so you
must be prepared every day. Just because you have been chosen one day does not
mean you will not be selected again another day. Your readiness to respond and
help with additional questions and comments will determine this part of your
grade. (If your group is never drawn out of the hat, your grade will come
entirely from your presentation).

>

> It is extremely important that students show each other the same courtesy
and attention that they show the instructor. The day other students lead is
not a "day off." If students exhibit behaviors that I find unacceptable on
these days, I will begin instituting quizzes and penalties to improve
deportment.

>

> **  
> JOURNAL RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS**

>

> Students will turn in written responses to the five assigned books. These
responses should be typed and a minimum of two pages in length. Students must
use standard 10 or 12 point type and one-inch margins on all sides.  Please
DOUBLE SPACE.  Double spacing is approximately 26 lines per page.  If you
single space  
>  or space and a half, you will be docked 10 points.  And remember:  no
plagiarism.

>

> The point of the journal is to show that you have not only read all of the
book, but also have thought about its implications.  You are encouraged, then,
to go beyond simply summarizing the major points of the book.  You may connect
it with other readings, discuss two or three of the major arguments, or
dispute its main points.  In other words, thoughtfulness helps.

>

> Journals will be marked with grades of check plus (95), check (85), and
check minus (75). I reserve the right, however, to give a lower grade to
anyone who does not take the assignment seriously or goes well below the
minimum expectations.

>

> The key difference between the check pluses and the checks will be critical
thinking skills and writing proficiency. Those who show that they have thought
carefully about what they have read, and those who exhibit superior writing
ability, will do better than those who write simple summaries of the works, or
those who make numerous writing errors.

>

> My definition of superior writing is formal, straightforward expository
prose.  In other words, please watch grammar and spelling errors, and avoid
second person, comma splices and faults, and other basic writing mistakes.  I
particularly dislike passive voice, so please use the active voice throughout
your essay.  You should also pick a tense and stick to it throughout the
piece, since it is very distracting to the reader to bounce between  
>  past and present over and over again.  Also, avoid wordiness and overly-
complicated sentence structure.  I would rather have a slightly shorter essay
that gets to the point than a long-winded, repetitious one that is the correct
length.  Nor do I think that complex writing is necessarily a sign of
intelligence.  The most important thing is that your reader understand what
you are trying to say.

>

> Journals are due at the BEGINNING of class. I will count off ten points a
day for every day the assignment is late, and will not accept any journal
papers more than a week after the due date.

Background   Over the past 20 years feminism and gender studies have given rise     to reexaminations of our common assumptions about social, cultural, and political     modes of expression such as religion, art, and philosophy. The character of     seemingly universal means of ordering the phenomena we perceive, the very     "we" or "I" of perception, is revealed in its gendered perspective. Gender     (along with race and class) belong to the material conditions of our respective     world views. Even the standard of objectivity of historiography and critical     philosophy has come under attack as a form of "male gaze."      Religion, as a traditional form of social ordering, is a pertinent subject     for gender critique. They enforce different roles for men and women in the     ritual, mythological, and socio-political order as well as provide an agency     of perpetuation of power relationships. At the same time, revolution and change     in the self-determination of men and women can likewise be justified from     religious sources, religion thus harboring the potential for both continuity     and transformation.      In particular, the monotheistic tradition of Israel, a formative element     of Western culture, provides a fertile area for the study of gender relations.     Monotheism itself is a critical statement against the gendered deities of     the Ancient Near East and thus deeply involved and implicated in the making     of gender identity in the West. Furthermore, Judaism in its various stages     of development, Jewish literature, and Jewish societies provide an interesting     case for the complexities of gender, especially in light of recent revisionary     studies informed by feminism and gender theory.     2. Course Objective   "Gender and Judaism" introduces to the interface between the biblical     monotheistic revolution (often cast as a revolt of patriarchy against preceding     matriarchal societies), its subsequent Judaic interpretations (where tension     exists between the image projected by religious literature composed by male     authorships and the often matriarchal social reality), and modern critical     approaches to the historiography and practice of Judaism. The latter aspects     (historiography and liturgical practice) speak to the current cultural debate     of modernism vs. postmodernism. The course also serves the interest     of introducing to strategies of text interpretation that are generally relevant     to an understanding of Judaism and other scripture based traditions.     3. Teaching Style   The class is run as a seminar. Readings must be completed in advance     of the relevant session so students' participation will not only be lively     but also based on sound information.     3. Prerequisites   One of the following or equivalent courses: RN101, RN216, AN260     4. Grading   One report on a general work of literature on gender not discussed     in class (3-5pp) due by the end of of the third week of classes (25%).

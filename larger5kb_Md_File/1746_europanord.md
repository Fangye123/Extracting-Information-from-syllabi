**Goals and Approach:**  


    
    
    Welcome to Northern Europe, 1300-1800!  You are embarking on a path that historians
    
    
    themselves have not yet fully marked out.  Therefore, you have the opportunity to participate
    
    
    in a very real sense in the making of a new field of history.  In this course we will
    
    
    be taking a fundamentally new approach to Europe's history, and consider societies and
    
    
    cultures within northern Europe to be more inter-related than separate.
    
    
    I have chosen the division of northern Europe based on the maritime ties that linked
    
    
    this region as early as the year 500 C.E.  As we will see, countries that seem different
    
    
    from one another in the popular mind were (and are) actually more closely
    
    
    related than one might think.  By looking for patterns of interaction we will be able
    
    
    to see not only these similarities but also understand more clearly how and why differences
    
    
    arose.



    
    
    Our method in the course will be to look at five major topics: gender and property relations;
    
    
    welfare and prisons; science and society; the transformation of warfare; and empire and the
    
    
    press.  In many cases we will look at these topics from the perspective of one major region,
    
    
    but I will also provide a broader perspective in the in-class presentations I do and in the
    
    
    classroom activities I design. Here are the regions that concern us: the British Isles,
    
    
    Denmark, Finland, northern Germany, the Low Countries, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.
    
    
    In this course we will strive to engage with the major processes that shaped northern
    
    
    European societies in the High Middle Ages and the early modern period.  My hope is, of course,
    
    
    that you will gain a greater understanding of the European past.  At the same time, I also
    
    
    want you to see this course as a vehicle for learning more about the world in which
    
    
    we currently live.  As I place a particular emphasis both on written and oral expression,
    
    
    it is also my hope that you will each improve your abilities in these areas as well.

  
**Specific Objectives of the Course:**

This course will provide you with opportunities to improve in the following
three areas of intellectual  
endeavor:

> **Contextual Knowledge:**  
>  In this course you will improve your knowledge of the events, historical
actors, and transformative  
> trends in northern Europe from 1300-1800, particularly in the areas of
gender, property, and social  
> rank; poverty, marginality, and society's attitudes towards them; the
Scientific Revolution;  
> warfare in northeastern Europe; and popular attitudes towards empire.  You
will gain information  
> on these topics by reading, evalutating, discussing, and writing about the
books and in-class  
> readings assigned for the course.

>

> **Historical Thinking:**  
>  Since this is a seminar in which our main goal will be to understand how
different historians have  
> tried to understand complex historical phenomena, you will improve your
ability to evaluate conflicting  
> interpretations of past events and issues.  You will do this in two ways: 1)
by contributing to discussions  
> in class, which is a major component of the course grade, and 2) by writing
the reaction papers and  
> working papers that form the writing component of the course.

>

> **Historical Research Skills:**  
>  The reaction papers in this course are not research papers as such since
they do not require a lot of  
> engagement with primary sources.  We will, however, discuss how historians
have tried to relate their work  
> to that of other historians (historiography); how they have used sources to
explore the past (methodology);  
> and how historians deal with the complex task of defining change,
continuity, and the causes behind each.  
> Thus, you will be thinking about how to conduct, organize, and present
research by examining and dicussing how  
> others have done these things and you will gain a knowledge of the terms and
categories that historians  
> use when they practice their craft.

    
    
    **A Seminar Environment:**
    
    
    I run my upper division courses as seminars for the most part.  This means that the
    
    
    focus of much of our classroom activities will not be me standing before you and
    
    
    lecturing.  Instead we will spend our time discussing the issues raised in the
    
    
    books that are assigned for the course (see below for these).  In order for a seminar
    
    
    to work we need the following things: 1) consistent participation from all members of
    
    
    the class in the dicussions and other activities 2) openness or the freedom that
    
    
    allows each individual to say what is on his or her mind 3) respect for boundaries,
    
    
    which means not saying things in a way that might be unacceptable to members of
    
    
    the class or unacceptable in a more general sense.  If we strive towards these three
    
    
    ideals, I guarantee you that this class will be exciting, fun, and even exhilerating!!!



    
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    
    Course work consists of four elements: participation in discussions, informal
    
    
    writings (called working papers), formal writings, and an essay-based final
    
    
    examination.



    
    
    **Participation:**
    
    
    a. Preparation: In order to understand the background presentations that I will
    
    
    give and participate in class discussions and other activities you will need
    
    
    to do the assigned readings.  Please budget time to complete readings for
    
    
    the date in which they appear in the assignment and reading schedule.
    
    
    The readings are in two forms, which are listed below.

> **Secondary Works:**

>

> John Robert Christianson, _On Tycho's Island: Tycho Brahe and his
Assistants, 1570-1601_  
>  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999)

>

> Martha Howell, _The Marriage Exchange: Property, Social Place, and Gender in
Cities of the_  
> _Low Countries, 1300-1500_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998)

>

> Robert Juette, _Poverty and Deviance in Early Modern Europe_ (Cambridge:
Cambridge University  
>  Press, 1994)

>

> Robert I. Frost, _The Northern Wars: War, State and Society in Northeastern
Europe, 1558-1721_  
>  London: Longman, 2000)

>

> **Primary Sources:**

>

> Jonathan Swift, _Gulliver's Travels: An Authoritative Text, the
Correspondence of Swift, Pope's_  
> _Verses on Gulliver's Travels, Critical Essays_ second edition, edited by
Robert A. Greenberg  
> (New York and London: W. W. Norton & Company, 1970)

>

> **Other Materials:**

>  
>  
>     When I deem it helpful, I will supplement these readings with short
source readings,

>  
>  
>     usually taken from online resources or my own collections of source
materials.

>

>  
    
    
    All of the above readings will be required for the course.  They are **available** at
    
    
    the CU Bookstore, although I do not require that you buy them there.



    
    
    **b. Discussion:** This may seem like a small thing and something unrelated
    
    
    to the real stuff (passing the exams and hammering out the papers).
    
    
    As this is an upper division course run largely as a seminar, however,
    
    
    I want to stress that participation in discussion **will count heavily (10%)**
    
    
    in your grade and that active participation often improves performance
    
    
    in the pressure situations.  I will gauge participation
    
    
    on a daily basis with a check, check-plus, check-minus system.



    
    
    **c. Informal Writings:** There is no textbook for this course.   Indeed,
    
    
    there are really no textbooks yet written for this field.  Therefore,
    
    
    for each of the major books we read I will assign one short writing
    
    
    exercise or working paper to help focus your reading of the books and
    
    
    to prepare you for our discussions.  For some papers I will be asking
    
    
    you to write up a brief analysis of the main point of a section or
    
    
    sections of the reading in question.  In other words, I won't want
    
    
    just a summary, but an actual discussion of what's going on in the
    
    
    piece. Other papers may require something slightly different.
    
    
    The emphasis will vary from paper to paper.  Informal writings
    
    
    will also be graded with a check, check-plus, check-minus system and
    
    
    include comments.  I will provide a sample of the sort of thing for
    
    
    which I'm hoping before the first assignment.  **These informal writings**
    
    
    **will be worth 10%** of the total mark, so please take them seriously.
    
    
    **d. Credit for Participation:** Informal writing(s) and class discussion and the reading
    
    
    quiz **will be worth 20%** of the final grade.   You can receive up to ten points for each
    
    
    day that you show up to class for a total of 130 and approximately 32 points for each working
    
    
    paper for a total of another 130 points.  An A in participation requires a minimum of
    
    
    207 points, a B 184, a C 161, and D a minimum of 138 points.



    
    
    **Reaction Papers: ** You will have to write four focused essays/reaction
    
    
    papers out of the five books). Thus you may choose the four papers that
    
    
    best suit you.  Each paper will account for **20% of your total grade** ,
    
    
    **but with particular attention paid to the degree to which**
    
    
    **people improve over course of the term.   **Due dates for the
    
    
    papers are listed below. [General guidelines](http://www.cameron.edu/~dougc/standardspage.htm) are to be found by clicking
    
    
    on the hypertext in this sentence.  Specific guidelines for the papers
    
    
    will be provided in this syllabus in a timely manner.  To find them look
    
    
    for the due dates below in the course assignment and reading schedule
    
    
    where you will find the paper title in hypertext; by clicking this
    
    
    hypertext you will arrive at the specific instructions for the paper.
    
    
    Guidelines for the grading standards that apply to written work done
    
    
    for this class may be found by clicking on the [hypertext](http://www.cameron.edu/~dougc/gradingcriteria.htm) in this sentence.
    
    
    **Guidelines for Academic Work:**
    
    
    **Late Papers:** The following policy applies to all late papers for this course that will receive
    
    a letter grade.  All papers submitted at any time on the day that the paper is due will be
    
    considered on time.  Papers submitted after that date, no matter what the reason may be, will
    
    be automatically marked down one grade.  You will then have ten days from the original due date
    
    to turn in the paper, during which time no further penalty for lateness will be incurred.
    
    
    If in that time you are unable to complete the work, the paper will receive a zero.



    
    
    **Late Informal Writings:** No late working papers (i.e. informal writings) will be accepted,
    
    
    so don't ask.  Remember, though, that your participation grade is a composite of your
    
    
    performance in class  and your performance  on informal writings.  Thus, as long as you
    
    
    achieve the number of participation points corresponding to the mark you desire, you'll
    
    
    be fine.



    
    
    **Missed Examinations:** As noted above, there is a final examination for this course.
    
    
    Makeup's for the final examination will be allowed only under extraordinary circumstances
    
    
    and the nature of any make-up final given will be determined at my discretion.



    
    
    **Plagiarism:** Plagiarism is the representation of the work of another as
    
    
    your own. In all of the writing you do for this course you must make clear
    
    
    to me which ideas in a paper are your own and which come from someone else.
    
    
    This is especially important for any formal essays you write. In these such
    
    
    essays you must cite all primary and secondary sources you use in accordance
    
    
    with the proper conventions. I will provide a sheet explaining the basics of
    
    
    citation before any formal essays come due. If for some reason you do not
    
    
    receive a copy of this hand-out, do not assume you will be exempt from following
    
    
    its guidelines as it will be available on the online syllabus. In cases of
    
    
    plagiarism, the Department of History and Government at CU  follows the
    
    
    plagiarism policy in the 2000-2001 "Student Handbook," pp. 207-211.  Please heed
    
    
    this warning as I am quite serious about it.
    
    
    **Reference Desk:**
    
    
    **Here is an on-line encyclopedia that you may find useful for this course.**
    
    
    **I once had more on-line reference tools, but sadly they have become**
    
    
    **restricted to subscription customers only.   On the bright side, the CU**
    
    
    **Library has a number of sources available through EBSCO and I strongly**
    
    
    **encourage you to use them.   Please see me if you require an orientation**
    
    
    **as to how to access these resources.**

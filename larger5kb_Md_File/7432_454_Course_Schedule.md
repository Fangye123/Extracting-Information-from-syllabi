**_454: Communication and Technology_**  
**_Syllabus_**

We will attempt to stick as closely to this schedule as possible. It is
expected that you willcomplete the reading material on the date assigned and
be prepared to discuss these essays in class. The instructor urges you in the
strongest possible terms to keep on schedule with the assigned readings and
exercises. If you don't, you will probably have to work much harder to keep up
with missed work. Additionally, in a small discussion class such as this one,
it is often quite obvious who has and has not completed the readings. Students
who try to participate in the discussion without having completed the readings
tend to degrade the intellectual experience for the other students.

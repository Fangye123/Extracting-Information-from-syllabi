**Course description and required texts:**

This course is an introduction to the ideas, themes, events, and personalities
that have shaped modern Western civilization, focusing on the centuries since
the Renaissance. While offering a general overview of the history of Europe
and the United States, this course seeks to encourage students to think
broadly about the nature and meaning of the liberal arts. It provides students
with an introduction to historical thinking and method. Students will analyze
primary sources, place them in historical context, discuss their ideas with
their colleagues, and interpret the sources in light of the broad themes that
have characterized the history of modern Europe and America.

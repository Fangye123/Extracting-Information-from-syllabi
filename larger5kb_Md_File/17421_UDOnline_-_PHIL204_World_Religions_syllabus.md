###  ![](IMG00003.GIF) **Grading Policy**

  * 2 EXAMS WORTH 35% EACH

Exams will consist of short answers and essay. No multiple choice questions
will be asked.

  * HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS WORTH A TOTAL OF 30%

There will be eight writing assignments, each consisting of a one or two page
essay responding to a specific question designed to prepare you for the day's
discussion.  For that reason, all papers must be written and mailed before
viewing the corresponding tape. These papers will be graded pass/pass
minus/not pass, and one grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.  A
"Pass" counts as an "A" (95), a "Pass Minus" counts as a "C" (75), a "Not
Pass" counts as an "F" (50), and any paper not turned in counts as a 0.  Any
student who receives a grade of "Pass" on every paper assigned will receive an
"A+" for the final homework average, which counts as a 100.  All papers must
be typed.

  * PARTICIPATION

Since you can't participate in the discussion, the burden is you to contact
the instructor to discuss the material periodically. The best time to reach me
is during office hours, but I can be reached at other times, and I do check my
voice and email often.

  * TAKING AN INCOMPLETE FOR THE COURSE

Some students will fall behind the course schedule. If you wish to receive an
incomplete at the end of the term, you must contact the instructor. If I don't
hear from you and the end of the course comes and goes, I will have to give
you an F for the course.  


###  **Course Objectives**

In this course we will take a critical yet sympathetic view of a wide range of
religious traditions, including Native American, Hindu, Buddhist, Daoist,
Jewish, Christian, and Muslim. This will require that we allow ourselves both
to identify with and to maintain our distance from each of the traditions
covered. We propose to explore textual roots and fundamental concerns, and to
look for similarities and differences. We will not be experts on World
Religions after taking this course, but we will be more sensitive to the kinds
of issues at stake in the study of religion, and more familiar with the
origins and evolutions of today's living religions, both Eastern and Western.
In general, it must be remembered that this is a philosophy class, so that
emphasis will be placed on critical thinking, clarity, and argumentation. That
is, the process is as important as the content.

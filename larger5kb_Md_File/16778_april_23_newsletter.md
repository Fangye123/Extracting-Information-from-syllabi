**Tuesday, April 23, 2002**

  
Dear fellow public servants,

  
The school year is winding down, but learning does not always take place  
in classrooms. Memorable lessons often come from sharing experiences and  
knowledge with peers, which is why you should consider attending the  
Social Movements Summit at Dartmouth College coming up. COOL (Campus  
Outreach Opportunity League) and the Tucker Foundation at Dartmouth are  
hosting the three-day conference of 125 students from all over who will  
discuss and reflect on the lessons learned from various social movements,  
including civil rights, queer rights, Native American rights, and the  
women's movements. The summit will come at crunch time for many students,  
but it is likely to be a worthwhile event that will be way more memorable than
a  
review session. Check out the Special Announcements for details.

**TE 490: Applications of Math for Elementary Teachers to the K-8 Classroom**  
  
**Fall 2001**  

Class meets Thursdays from 3:00 - 4:50 p.m.

**Instructor:** Tamara Arizola  

**Office:** E177 (College of Education Bldg) Office Hours: Thursdays from 2:00
- 2:50 p.m.

**Telephone:** office (989) 964-4115 home (989) 790-0860 or by appointment  
  
  
**Course Prerequisites**  
    Students must have successfully completed MATH 110: Math for Elementary Teachers or have instructor permission.  
  
  
  
**Course Description**  
    This course is designed to explore the teaching of K-8 mathematics in a manner consistent with the Principals and Standards of School Mathematics published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (2000) and the Michigan Curriculum  
Framework standards and benchmarks for mathematics. The focus is on methods
and materials that are most effective in teaching mathematics to elementary
and middle school students and this course is taught as an extension of MATH
110: Math for Elementary Teachers.

  
**Teacher as Decision Maker Model**  
    The following model of the teacher as decision maker has been adopted by the Department of Teacher Education at SVSU and provides a foundation upon which the activities and ideas in this course are based. As a future teacher you will have the  
opportunity to develop your decision making skills as you participate in this
course and its related field experience. Within this general model, you will
also need to consider several key factors for making decisions about designing
thoughtful and meaningful mathematics instruction. These factors include
mathematics content, instructional methods, and the classroom environment.  
  
  
  
**Course Outcomes**

* Become familiar with the NCTM's Principals and Standards for School Mathematics and the Michigan Curriculum Framework for mathematics;  
  
* Experience a variety of methods for teaching mathematics including the use of manipulatives, small group and whole group instruction, and "good" questioning strategies;  
  
* Prepare and teach a meaningful, objective-based mathematics lesson in an area K-8 classroom and reflect upon your instruction and the effectiveness of the lesson;  
  
* Critically evaluate and reflect upon teaching materials, strategies, and ideas;  
  
* Explore a variety of assessment strategies.  

  
**Required Course Materials**  
    There are no required materials; however, the following materials are strongly recommended:  
  
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (2000). Principals and Standards
for School Mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics.

**Teaching Strategies**  
    Course content will be explored through videos, cooperative groups, small group discussion, and independent assignments.  
  
  
  
**Course Calendar**  
    The following schedule is meant as a guide to the course. Teaching and learning requires flexibility. If changes are made, they will be clearly communicated in class.

**Course Requirements/Assignments**  
  
_**Attendance and Participation**_  
Each student will be expected to attend all classes and participate in all
activities. **\- 20** points for each unexcused absence and **-10** points for
each excused absence

  
_**Link to Literature assignment**_                          **Due Date:
September 27, 2001  
** Each student will be asked to write a lesson that uses children's
literature in the teaching of the mathematics.

  
_**Adapt-a-Lesson assignment**_                               **    ** **Due
date: October 11, 2001**  
Each student will be expected to choose a lesson plan that already has a grade
level indicated on it, adapt that lesson to fit either the grade above or
below, and be able to explain the changes that they made and their reasons for
the adaptations.

  
_**Field Experience**_            **Must be completed no later than November
15, 2001**  
Each student will be expected to teach at least one lesson in an area K-8
classroom. A lesson plan will be written and turned in to the course
instructor prior to teaching the assignment and the student will be evaluated
by the instructor during their field experience. A reflection of the lesson
must be turned in no later than one week after the lesson has been taught.

  
_**Learning Log**_                                **Due dates: October 18 &
December 6, 2001**  
Each student will be asked to keep a learning log to reflect upon the
experiences of each class and to record thoughts regarding any assigned
articles or other readings.

  
_**Pocket Full of Lessons assignment**                     _**Due date:
November 29, 2001**  
Each student will be required to find ten lesson plans, identify the
appropriate grade level, state the corresponding benchmarks and write a short
reflection. (No more than 5 of the lessons can be from the Internet.)

  
_**Portfolio**_                                                         **Due
date: December 13, 2001**  
At the end of the course each student will have prepared a professional
portfolio that demonstrates what they have learned about becoming a teacher of
mathematics through essays, examples of assignments, lesson plans, reflections
and/or pictures.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Evaluation and Grading Policy**

**Attendance and participation  
\- 20** points for each unexcused absence and **-10** points for each excused
absence | **140**  
---|---  
**Adapt-a-Lesson assignment** | **10**  
**Link to Literature assignment** | **10**  
**Learning Log** | **20**  
**Field Experience** | **50**  
**Pocket Full of Lessons assignment** | **50**  
**Portfolio** | **50**  
  
**TOTAL possible** | **330**  
  
**    **  

The semester grade will be computed according to the following criteria:  
TOTAL = 330 pts.

Final course grades will be assigned to each student on the following scale:

A = 95-100% |  B+ = 86-89% |  C+ = 75-79% |  D = 60-69% |  F = below 60%  
---|---|---|---|---  
A- = 90-94% |  B = 83-85% |  C = 70-74% |   |  
  | B- = 80-82% |   |   |  
  


    All due dates are clearly indicated in this syllabus. Unless a due date is changed, you must turn the assignment in on (or before) the date it is due. If the university should close due to inclement weather, all assignments that were due for the cancelled class in addition to the assignments due according to the class schedule are due at the next class meeting.  
    Assignments that are turned in late (except in the case of university closing due to inclement weather) may have a reduction in the grade because work cannot be evaluated fairly when someone has had more time to complete it than others. If you are unable to attend class on the day an assignment is due, you need to make sure the assignment is turned in by the time class begins. Assignments that are not turned in will be recorded as a zero.  
    Assignments will be evaluated based on the requirements and criteria specified for each. Please attach the appropriate grading rubric before submitting your assignment. All work must have correct grammar, spelling, format, content, and be completed as assigned. Any revisions to assignments will be averaged with the original score. Revisions to assignments may not be submitted after the last class.  
    **All assignments should be typed (or use a word processor), double spaced, and (as a guideline) use 1-inch margins with 12pt. or 10cpi font size. These guidelines do not apply to your learning log. It may be handwritten but must be legible.**  
  
  
**Attendance Policy**  
    Each student is expected to attend and to participate in each scheduled class, including field experience. You must contact the instructor prior to an absence, and all absences must be excused (e.g., illness, death in the family).   
  
**Please Note**  
    Students with disabilities that may restrict full participation in course activities are encouraged to meet with the instructor or contact the SVSU office of Disability Services, Wickes Hall, Room 177 for assistance.  
  
**Academic Honesty Policy**  
    Except in those instances when students are engaged in collaborative efforts, it will be expected that students will complete and submit their own work. Ideas taken verbatim or paraphrased from other sources should be clearly acknowledged through the inclusion of appropriate reference notes. When in doubt regarding the appropriate way to handle a specific situation, students should consult with the course instructor. Instances of academic dishonesty may result in a failing grade for this course. Please refer to Section 1.8 of the Code of Student Conduct in the Student Handbook.

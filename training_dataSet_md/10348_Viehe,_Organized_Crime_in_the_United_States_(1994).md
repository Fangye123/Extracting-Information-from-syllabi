### PAPERS

Two FOUR-PAGE papers are required containing approximately 1000 words each. In
each paper, the student must compare and contrast two chapters from the
READER.

  * The first paper concerning Chapters 2-4, 7, and 8 is due _Wednesday, October 19_ ; 
  * the second paper concerning Chapters 5, 6, and 9-13 is due _Wednesday, November 16_.

No Chapter may be reviewed twice. Late papers are penalized one full grade for
every day late.  
  
  

### BOOK REVIEW

A TEN-PAGE book review containing approximately 2500 words is required. The
book review is the SUPPLEMENTARY READING chosen by the student. This review
will critically evaluate:

  1. the author's thesis; 
  2. the development of that thesis; 
  3. the book's major points; 
  4. the kinds of sources used; 
  5. as well as the book's strengths and weaknesses.

Implicit in this requirement is a presentation of the thesis, and a
determination on whether the author relied on primary or secondary sources.  
  
    _**Primary Sources**_ include private papers, government documents, newspapers, journals, personal interviews, etc.     _**Secondary Sources**_ generally refer to books, magazines, and other published works. Other items to cover include the book's organization, the author's writing style, and any biases. Finally, the review should include your opinion of the book, and whether you recommend it to others.  
  
The book review is due _Wednesday, November 23_. Late reviews will be
penalized one full grade for every day late.

### GRADING

**PAPERS** : Your book review and papers will be graded on how well they are
thought through and organized, how well the subject is dealt with, and how
well they are written. Spelling, grammar, sentence structure, organization,
and style also will affect your grade.  
  
_**Footnotes**_ must be used for any direct quotation, or when you paraphrase
an author. When you copy the words of another, put those words inside
quotation marks and acknowledge the source with a footnote. When you
paraphrase the words of another, use your own words and your own sentence
structure, followed by a footnote citing the source of the idea. Failure to
follow these guidelines may result in the charge of plagiarism.  
  
_**Plagiarism**_. Failure to give proper credit is PLAGIARISM. It will not be
tolerated. Plagiarism is literary theft. The punishment for plagiarism is
either an "F" on the paper or book review, and/or and "F" in the course.  
  
**EXAMS** : There will be a Midterm and Final Examination.

  * Midterm: Wednesday, October 26
  * Final: Wednesday, December 7, 8-10 a.m.

**ATTENDANCE** is Mandatory. Roll will be taken. Students with excellent
attendance will be given the benefit of the doubt when class grades are
determined at the end of the quarter.

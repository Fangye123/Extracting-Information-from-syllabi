GOALS **ENCOUNTERING HISTORY**

This course serves as an introduction to American History at the college
level. The purpose of the course is to enable you to use texts, documents, and
secondary readings to understand the life experiences of ordinary people from
different races and cultures. We will explore how material conditions, that
is, the environment, production and consumption of goods, and use of social
space interacted with religious, political, and interpersonal beliefs to shape
experience. Our goal is to arrive at an understanding of why and how life in
the past differed from region to region and changed over time during what is
regarded as the first half of the history of the United States.

In addition we will examine the "construction" of history in three ways: one,
by developing our own interpretations of primary sources; two, by discussing
important and sometimes conflicting secondary works and thirdly, by evaluating
primary documents on the World Wide Web.  In these ways, we can begin to see
that history is an interpretation of the past shaped by the concerns of the
present.

**REQUIREMENTS** _Class Preparation **:**_

The most important requirement for this course is a careful reading of the
assignments and thoughtful participation in class discussion and group
exercises. The assigned reading must be done before coming to class. To
prepare for class participation, the student should take notes on the reading
and develop questions for class discussion.  A Reading Analysis assignment for
each chapter (except 7 and 8) is due at the beginning of class on Tuesdays.
The assignments can be found on the Course webpage. It is each student's
responsibility to get the assignment even if absent from class and to complete
it on time. Late assignments will not be accepted, however, each student may
omit two of the weekly assignments without penalty. There will be one mid-term
exam and one final exam. Attendance is required and more than two absences
will adversely affect your grade. Please bring both books and notes to class
with you.

_Final Project:_

The final project is based on group work that will utilize primary sources and
the understanding of developments in American history gained during the course
to create a biography or community study of a real or imaginary historical
figure or place that will be presented presented in class. The final project
can take the form of a play, video, or a web page linked to the Course web
site if approved by Dr. Hunter well in advance. Detailed instructions will be
provided later in the semester.

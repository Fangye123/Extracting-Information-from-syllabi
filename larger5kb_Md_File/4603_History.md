COURSE OBJECTIVES:  
This course is designed to help you gain an in depth understanding of some of
the philosophers (and ideas) influential in developing the science of
psychology. You should recognize that, with few exceptions, philosophers
familiarize themselves with the works of prior thinkers as they develop their
own ideas.  With this in mind, one important goal of this course is for you to
gain an understanding of the reasons that certain questions have been
persistently asked, and the techniques philosophers and scientists have used
in attempting to answer these questions.  An equally important goal is for you
to develop an understanding of how and why different ideas gained acceptance
or were rejected at different times throughout history.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
_Exams:_ There will be 4 multiple-choice exams during the semester, each
containing 40 questions.   Exams will not be comprehensive, but with the
following exception: Questions from Chapter 1 will appear on each exam.  Exams
will be given on Tuesday of the week scheduled, at the beginning of the class
period.  Make up exams will be scheduled only during finals week, on
Wednesday, 12/12, at 10:00 a.m., and 1:00 p.m., and will comprise both
multiple choice and short essay questions.  Exams not taken during the
scheduled week may be made up only if a student provides acceptable
documentation supporting a medical or other emergency that caused the student
to be absent.  The final exam is Tuesday, 12/11, at 6:30 P.M.  
_Position papers_ : You will be required to write two position papers during
the semester, each worth a maximum of 20 points.  The requirememts for these
position papers are outlined in a separate handout.  
_Extra credit:_   You may earn up to 12 points of extra credit throughout the
semester by writing 1-2 page responses to selected discussion questions.  Each
discussion question response that you submit will be worth 1-4 points, and you
may submit one, two, or three discussion question responses.  The requirements
for discussion question responses as well as a list of acceptable discussion
questions is are available in a separate handout.

BLACKBOARD:  
_What is Blackboard?_   Blackboard is a web-based, course delivery system
available through the Cameron computer network.  
In this course, lecture notes, guidelines for assignments, and grades (except
for extra credit) will be available to you.  
_How to use Blackboard:_   A separate handout describes how to access and use
Blackboard.

GENERAL CLASS POLICIES:

1\. Children are not permitted in the classroom.

2\. Cell phones and pagers are not permitted; in an emergency, you may be
contacted  
    through the Psychology department, 581-2360   
3\. Plagiarism, discussed in a separate handout, is a serious academic
offense, and  
    constitutes academic dishonesty.   
4\. Cheating: Convincing evidence of academic dishonesty will result in
appropriate  
    actions as provided by the Cameron University [Code of Student Conduct](http://www.cameron.edu/student_affairs/dean_of_students/student_conduct/index.html).   
5\. Disruptive behavior in class will not be tolerated.  A first offense will
usually result  
    in a warning.  Subsequent instances will result in a written warning, which can lead to   
    formal disciplinary action.

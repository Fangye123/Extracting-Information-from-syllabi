This course will introduce you to the nonprofit sector as a major phenomenon,
largely ignored, in American society. The course will walk through major
concepts relating to the nonprofit or "third" sector. While I will try to give
you a more or less orderly presentation to nonprofit organizations as a type
of organization in which you might work, it also is important to understand
them in cultural and historical context. "Management" ideas are not
necessarily a very good way of understanding what these organizations about,
so we will be reading some materials from political science, economics,
religion, history, anthropology, and sociology to better understand what
nonprofit organizations are about and why they are significant in American
society.

Students are required to carry out a major project during the semester and
present the results to the class in a presentation 35-45 minutes in length
during one of the last four classes of the semester. Time slots for
presentations will be chosen randomly in the second week of class. You must
let me know if you have special needs or problems that make it impossible for
you to present on one of the last four Mondays of the term. Your in-class
presentation will count for 20% of your grade and your written report
containing the material you present will count for 25%. People may propose
projects that fit special interest. However, I expect most students to do a
case study of a nonprofit organization.

The case study involves two parts, a class presentation and a final report
that you turn in at the end of the semester. Normally the report includes a
narrative in which students talk about the organization that they have studied
and documentary information that they have collected about the organization
which might include annual reports, publications, interviews, public reports,
or other sorts of information. It works best if you do a case study of a
nonprofit that is local since you'll want to make some personal contacts.
Student case studies are often set up as consulting arrangements or
internships.

The mode of your report must be in the form of a web site. This may be a
collaborative project with the organization you study. Students probably will
want to customize the web site for purposes of their presentation. It is easy
to set up a web site so it is similar to a Powerpoint presentation. We will
spend a substantial amount of time in class helping you develop web site
building skills. This is a challenging task, and people may want to do this in
teams. Students not doing a case study will have to work out the form of their
presentation with me.

At four points in the semester, students must complete and hand in
**[discussion essays](Discussion.html)** , 2-3 pages in length. These will be
graded and altogether will count 40% of your grade. I will provide sets of
questions related to each class session. We will use those questions in our
class discussions. Students who do discussion questions for that class will be
expected to take an active role in the class discussion and they must hand in
their answers at the end of that class to receive credit. Students may
complete all of their questions early in the term.

Participation will count 15%. This includes showing up to class, talking in
class, handing in assignments on time, and doing assignments in a serious way.
Since this is a capstone and most students are second semester seniors, this
may be a challenge!  
Since your case study project and final report make up nearly half of your
grade, it is important that you get started early and that you take the
project seriously. You will need to pick the focus for your case study by the
third week of class and I will give a series of assignments designed for you
to collect the data you need by Spring Break. This will allow you time after
Spring Break to develop your web site.

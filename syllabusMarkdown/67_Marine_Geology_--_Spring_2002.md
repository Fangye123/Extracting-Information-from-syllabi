## **MNS 354F: Marine Geology \- Spring 2002**

  
**Instructor:** [ Henrietta N. Edmonds](../index.html), Department of Marine
Science  
Office: L317, Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas  
phone: (361) 749-6772  
[email: edmonds@utmsi.utexas.edu](mailto:edmonds@utmsi.utexas.edu)  
  
Meeting time: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11-12:30  
Place: ACES 2.402 (Austin) and MSI Video Classroom (Port Aransas)  
  
Most lectures will be delivered via the Austin-Port Aransas video link. I will
be in Austin on average one week out of every 3 or 4. When I am in Port
Aransas, I will not have defined **office hours** other than that I will
always be at my desk for the two hours before class Ã± email is the best way to
reach me (phone is good, but long distance) and can be used any time. When I
am in Austin, I will keep you informed of my whereabouts and availability, but
will always be available between 9 and 11 a.m. on class days, in the Marine
Science office, ESB 102.

## **Web site**

[ Lecture notes](lectures.html) (i.e., downloadable images of my PowerPoint
slides) will be available on this web site. You will need a free PDF reader
(e.g., Adobe Acrobat Reader) to download and view the files. While we will
endeavor to adhere to the indicated lecture schedule, changes may occur. Some
flexibility is built in, and any major changes will be announced well in
advance. You are expected to keep up with the indicated reading.  
  
You will also find [links to various web resources](notes&links.html) on the
site, updated through the semester. [News and class reminders ](news.html)will
be posted as well. Please plan to check the site fairly regularly.

## Aims of the course:

The goal of the course is to develop an understanding of the processes
controlling the structure and evolution of the ocean basins, and the tools and
methods used by marine scientists in developing this understanding.  
  
The history of the studies of plate tectonics and marine geology are heavily
intertwined: for instance, most modern plate boundaries reside in the oceans.
The course will therefore start with an introduction to plate tectonics, and
the major types of plate boundaries and intra-plate tectonic processes in the
ocean. We will study the structure and composition of oceanic crust produced
at spreading centers, its subsequent alteration by on- and off-axis
interaction with seawater, its burial by sediments and consumption in
collision zones. We will look at the distribution and composition of major
sediment types, and the use of the sedimentary record for deciphering the
geological, climatological, and oceanographic histories of the oceans.

## **Readings**

You are not required to purchase a textbook for the course. Several books are
on reserve in the Geology Library. Readings from these texts and other sources
will be assigned throughout the semester. These assignments will be given in
class and [posted on the web site](lectures.html). You are responsible for any
reading I assign. Some of the books are included as background and reference
material for those of you with different backgrounds. All are available for 2
hour checkout.

The books on reserve are:

_Marine Geology_ , by J.P. Kennett  
_Marine Geology: A Planet Earth Perspective_ , by R.N. Anderson  
_The Sea Floor: An Introduction to Marine Geology_ , by E. Seibold and W.
Berger  
_The Ocean Basins: Their Structure and Evolution_ , by the Open University
Course Team  
_Ocean Chemistry and Deep Sea Sediments_ , by the Open University Course Team  
_The Solid Earth: An Introduction to Global Geophysics_ , by C.M.R. Fowler  
_The Face of the Deep_ , by B. Heezen and C. Hollister  
_Photographic Atlas of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge Rift Valley_ , by Ballard and
Moore

## Course Requirements and Grading

Grading will be based on four quizzes, a report, and a final exam. The
relative importance of each to the final grade is as follows:  
  
In-class quizzes: 60% (four quizzes at 15% each)  
Current events report: 10%  
Final Exam (cumulative): 30%  
  
Quizzes will be relatively frequent and are intended to give both me and you
an ongoing sense of your progress adn understanding of the course material.
They will be a combination of multiple choice, short answer, and more thought-
provoking questions.

For the report, you must write a five page (roughly) review or summary of a
recent finding or news report having to do with Marine Geology. You may hand
this in at any time during the semester, but it must be handed in before the
last day of class, May 2.

example of a recent news item.

## **Officialdom**

_**Other course requirements include class attendance.**_ Anticipated absences
from tests or the final exam should be handled in advance through the
infirmary or Dean of Students. Unanticipated absences from the tests will be
dealt with on a case by case basis and are likely to involve an additional
project of some sort. Unanticipated absence from the final exam must be dealt
with through the Dean of Students.  
  
Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be handled according to
the rules of the University.  
  
Please notify me of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate
a disability-related need. You will be requested to provide documentation to
the Dean of Students' Office, in order that the most appropriate
accommodations can be determined. Specialized services are available on campus
through Services for Students with Disabilities. For more information, contact
the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.

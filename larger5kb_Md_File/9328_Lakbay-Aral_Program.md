**What is Lakbay-Aral?**

Lakbay-Aral, a Filipino term literally translated as travel-study, is a
program started by the [ Commission on Filipinos Overseas
](http://www.cfo.gov) in 1983 to provide young Filipinos overseas with an
opportunity to learn more about their roots and heritage by experiencing life
in the Philippines.

The **PH 400: Lakbay-Aral: A Philippine Immersion Experience** course will
begin on July 1st, 2002 and end on August 5th, 2002. The pre-travel portion of
the course taken July 1st through July 18th may be taken either at St. Norbert
College or via the Internet. The in-country travel portion of the course will
be July 19th through August 5th.

**What are the Benefits of Lakbay-Aral?**

A firsthand study of the Philippines has significant academic value for
students of all backgrounds. Here are just a few of the many reasons for
taking this exciting course:

， The history of the Philippines is simply fascinating. It is a history that
intersects with American history at crucial points because the Philippines was
once a colonial possession of the United States.

， Studying the Philippines provides an excellent opportunity for students to
examine issues that confront the developing world.

， Filipino culture is steeped in traditions and rituals. These must be
experienced firsthand!

， Travel in the Philippines allows students to deepen their understanding of
Catholicism.

， Economically and geo-politically the Philippines is important because it is
situated at the crossroads of Southeast Asia.

， Filipino Americans will learn a great deal about their family's cultural
heritage. And, students from non-Filipino backgrounds will develop a deeper
understanding of Americans with cultural roots in Asia.

， The course complements coursework in a variety of fields, e.g.,
International Studies, History, Economics, Anthropology and Political Science.

**How is Lakbay-Aral conducted?**

The first three weeks will be held at St. Norbert College. Students will study
the history, value systems, political structure, religious traditions and
cultural heritage of the Philippines. While it is preferred that students in
the program come to St. Norbert for the three-week pre-travel portion of the
course, students may take the pre-travel portion of the course through
"distance learning" technologies. This is for students generally living 500 or
more miles away from St. Norbert College. Click here to get the [ Course
Requirements ](lakbay_course.html).

The remaining two weeks will take place in the Philippines where students are
able to learn through classroom and on-site activities. It features lectures
and workshops on Philippine history, geography, and culture; guided tours to
historical landmarks; interaction with Filipino students, members of
indigenous communities, and government officials and community leaders; as
well as participation in traditional rites and festivals. Click here to get

"The course credit can be transferred to almost any college or university,"
said John Holder, Ph.D., chair of the Philippine Studies Committee at St.
Norbert College. "The course provides students a unique opportunity to learn
firsthand about an Asian culture that is steeped in tradition and has close
historical ties to the United States."

**Methods in American Studies** focuses on the varied approaches one can use
to study, think about, and analyze a culture, in this case that of the United
States. Along with the additional books listed under "Suggested Readings," the
common and required texts offer us the skills, questions, theories we rely on
as we ask ourselves questions like:

     what makes a culture work or not work?     how do we think about the relationships among different groups?     what are the relationships among different aspects of a society, such as its politics and its mass culture?     what is the relationship between theory and data?     what possibilities and limitations are there to the stances authors take?     what are the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches or methods? 

A note on Web Sites. The American Studies Association, the national
professional organization in the field, has established the Crossroads
project, which is the place to begin any search. Among the sites with which it
will connect you are syllabi for other courses, discussion groups in the
fields, and sources for data (such as the many at the Library of Congress).
You can reach this site via the American Studies web page on Smith.edu

I will begin here with other sites of interest. Please bring additional ones
to my attention.

**September 7:** Introduction

**September 9:** A History of American Studies

    ***** Gene Wise, " 'Paradigm Dramas' " (1979), in Maddox, _Locating American Studies_. 

I assign the article by Wise largely to help students answer the question
"What is American Studies" and to provide them with a sense that the field has
a relatively long and complicated past. Pay particular attention to what he
labels as the "intellectual history synthesis" in American Studies, for it was
this approach that is the base point of later changes. What is the
relationship of this approach to the Cold War? What elements from his list on
pp. 306-07 do you find still acceptable as a statement of American culture?
After Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall in the late 1960s, what new elements too
its place (see pp. 331-32)? Two decades after Wise wrote, can we see the
emergence of yet another synthesis in the emphasis on race, class, and gender?
If so, what are the challenges and limitations of such a focus?

**Week of September 13:**

    ***** Robert Orsi, _Thank You, St. Jude: Women's Devotion To the Patron Saint of Hopeless Causes_ (1995) 

     Tuesday: Preface, 1-94  
    Thursday: 95-211. 

    **Thurs. September 16: draft of short paper due in class**  
![spacer](images/1pixel.gif) (optional)

    Mr. Orsi will speak at Smith, late afternoon, Thursday, September 16 

This is the first time I have used this book and I decided to do so for
several reasons. It enables us to focus on American religion, a subject that
academics often shy away from and that has a miniscule place in the Smith
education. More importantly for our purposes, Orsi's book serves several
useful purposes as we begin to examine how to interpret a culture. First, it
provides a compelling example of cultural history, in this case a history of
the traditions of popular religion, especially among women, in the Roman
Catholic tradition. So think about it in contrast with other kinds of history
(political, social) with which you are familiar. Secondly, Orsi uses several
distinctive sources that enable him to recover the world view of ordinary
Americans, whose consciousness is often out of reach to scholars. Finally,
Orsi uses a variety of techniques-history, anthropology, textual analysis-that
together offer an exemplary example of what students in American Studies can
do.

**Week of September 20:** The Debate Over American Studies

**Short (4 page) paper due Thursday September 23** (bring to class).

    

Tuesday:     ***** Henry Nash Smith, "Can American Studies Develop a Method?"
(1957), in Maddox.  
***** Bruce Kuklick, "Myth and Symbol in American Studies" (1972) in Maddox.  
**#** Susan Willis, "Learning From the Banana" (1987)  
***** Alice Kessler-Harris, "Cultural Locations: Positioning American Studies
in the Great Debate" (1992), in Maddox.  
***** Ramon Guiterrez, "Community, Patriarchy And Individualism: The Politics
of Chicano History and the Dream of Equality" (1993), in Maddox.  
***** Peter Barry, _Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural
Theory_ (1995), "Ten Tenets of liberal humanism," pp. 16-21; "The Transition
To Theory," pp. 32-36.

Written over thirty years apart, the articles by Smith, Kuklick, Willis,
Kessler-Harris, and Guiterrez reflect major changes in the history of American
Studies. Smith, a professor of English, is wrestling with the issue of the
place of "high" culture in the study of an entire culture. Pay particular
attention to the evaluations he places on mass or popular culture and to high
culture. Think carefully about the issue of whether the best way to comprehend
an entire culture is through its most "quality" or elite expressions.
Kuklick's essay is the one of the most important critiques of Smith's position
and more generally of the approach Wise identified as the "intellectual
history synthesis" and others have called the "myth and symbol" approach.

Willis wishes to eliminate Smith's hierarchical stance--to examine bananas in
elite literature and in supermarkets as equally valid ways into the study of a
society. How convincing is she in this effort? In addition, she offers us a
brief discussion of neo-Marxism. How useful do you find her analysis of the
dynamics of the economic system as it affects our daily lives? Think also of
her article as part of an attempt to provide a cultural analysis of everyday
life, one in which she applies literary analysis and a way of "reading" common
experiences. Then Kessler-Harris connect debates within American Studies with
contemporary discussions of multi-culturalism. Guiterrez applies key concepts
in cultural studies to the lives of Chicanos. Barry provides important
background information on the shift from liberal humanism (represented in
large measure by Smith) and more theoretical approaches you will encounter
throughout the semester.

Thursday: Contemporary Issues in American Studies     ***** Kevin Mumford,
"Homosex Changes: Race, Cultural Geography and the Emergence of the Gay"
(1996), in Maddox.     ***** Barry, _Beginning Theory_ , "Lesbian/gay
criticism," pp. 139-53.     ***** K. Scott Wong, "The Transformation of
Culture: Three Chinese Views of America" (1996) in Maddox.     ***** George
Lipsitz, "Listening to Learn and Learning to Listen: Popular Culture, Cultural
Theory, and American Studies" (1990), in Maddox.     ***** Barry, _Beginning
Theory_ , "Structuralism," pp. 39-59 and "Post-Structuralism and
deconstruction," pp. 61-79.

The articles by Mumford, Wong, and Lipsitz represent recent emphases in
American studies: gay/lesbian studies, Asian American studies, and the attempt
to develop a theory of culture that both relies on high theory and gives
importance to low culture. Once again, Barry provides accessible treatments of
key issues: lesbian/gay criticism, as well as some of the literary theories
that undergird what others write.

**Week of September 27:** Literary Historicism and Canon Formation

Tuesday:     ***** Jane Tompkins, _Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of
American Fiction, 1790-1860_ (1985).  
Introduction and chapters 1, 5, 6, and 7     ***** Barry, _Beginning Theory_ ,
"New historicism and cultural materialism," 172-89.     ***** Nina Baym,
"Melodramas of Beset Manhood: How Theories of American Fiction Exclude Women
Authors" (1981), in Maddox.

Thursday: selections from     **#** Nathaniel Hawthorne, _Scarlet Letter_
**#** Susan Warner, _Wide Wide World_     **#** Harriet Beecher Stowe, _Uncle
Tom's Cabin_

In this immensely influential and controversial book, Tompkins launched a
feminist reconsideration of the canon--the list of widely accepted classics in
literature or in any other field. What do you think of her argument that most
if not all judgments about quality are relative to the conditions under which
they were produced? What does Tompkins mean by "cultural work"? Are you
willing to use this as your yardstick for making literary judgments about the
excerpts on childhood written by Stowe, Warner, and Hawthorne? Can you think
of circumstances under which it would be possible to reconcile popularity and
quality? As you read the selections from novels of the 1850s, think about how
applicable are the arguments of Tompkins. Finally, in what ways does Baym
provide another perspective on issues of canon formation and gender?

**Week of October 4:** An Anthropology of Literary Culture

    

***** Janice Radway, _Reading the Romance: Women, Patriarchy, and Popular
Literature_ (1984, use 1991 edition).      Tuesday: Introduction, chapters 1,
2, and 3  

Thursday: chapters 4, 5 (157-8 and 183-5), 6 and Conclusion     Barry,
_Beginning Theory_ , "Psychoanalytic criticism," pp. 96-118; "Feminist
criticism," pp. 121-36.

This is also an immensely influential book. Written by a literary scholar, who
is a recent president of the American Studies Association, it involves an
anthropology of reading. In addition, Radway uses psychoanalytic, Marxist,
feminist, and literary theories. How do you evaluate the balance between
theory and data? What you do think of the relationship of anthropologist and
subjects?

**Week of October 11:** Anthropology, Participant Observation, Latinos, and
Post-Modernism

    **Thurs. October 15: draft of short paper due, (bring to class)** (optional) 

     Tuesday: no classes 

    

Thursday:     ***** Jos谷 Lim車n, _Dancing With the Devil: South Texas_ (1994),
preface, 5-17, and 76-94, 97-207     **#** Clifford Geertz, "Deep Play: Notes
on the Balinese Cockfight" (1992)      Barry, _Beginning Theory_ ,
"Postmodernism," 81-94; "Marxist Criticism," pp. 156-70.     **#** T. J.
Jackson Lears, "The Concept of Cultural Hegemony: Problems and Prospects"
(1985)

The article by Geertz is an immensely influential one, not only among
anthropologists but also among historians and literary critics. Central to
what Geertz does here is tell us how to think of worldly events as "texts"
that we can "read" and in turn of culture as a series of texts. How does he
move beyond what Henry Nash Smith said about culture, texts, and hierarchy?
Can you think of ways of applying what Geertz says modern America? In
addition, think about the stance here of the anthropologist to the people he
is studying. In _Dancing With the Devil_ , Lim車n offers us an example of a
kind of anthropology quite different from that of Geertz. Think about how
Lim車n and Geertz differ in how they position themselves via a vis the people
they study. In addition, consider Lim車n's use of post-modernism, something he
explores in both the economy and the culture. Finally, the article by Lears
explores the work of Antonio Gramsci, an Italian Marxist of the 1930s, who has
influenced many cultural analysts.

**Week of October 18:** Asian Americans and Cultural Studies

**Second short (6 page) paper due Thursday October 21** (bring to class).
Topics to be discussed beforehand.

    

***** Lisa Lowe, _Immigrant Acts: On Asian American Cultural Politics_ (1996)

    

Tuesday: preface and chapters 1, 3     ***** Barry, _Beginning Theory_ ,
191-200.     Thursday, chapters 5, 7, and Epilogue

In _Immigrant Acts_ , Lowe offers an example of contemporary thinking in
cultural studies. Especially important are her materialist critique, her
emphasis on sources of the oppositional, and her use of concepts key to post-
modernists: decentering, subaltern, fluid identities, hybridity, and border
crossing.

**Week of October 25:** Art History: Historicism and Formalism

    

Tuesday:     **#** Roque, Oswaldo R., "The _Oxbow_ by Thomas Cole: Iconography
of an American Landscape Painting" (1984)     **#** Alan Wallach, "Thomas Cole
and the Aristocracy" (1981)     **#** Alan Wallach, "Making A Picture of the
View from Mt. Holyoke" (1993)

     Thursday-no class. American Studies Association meeting in Montreal 

A new generation of art historians (including John Davis) is transforming the
study of art history by combining a broadened sense of appropriate visual
material with the perspectives of history and cultural studies. I bring
together several articles, all of them focused on the work of Thomas Cole. I
do so in order to provoke a discussion of the alternative approaches art
historians use in examining the same subject.

**Week of November 1:** Social History, Hegemony and Popular Culture

    

***** Lizabeth Cohen, _Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago,
1919-1939_ (1990)

     Tuesday: Introduction, pp. 94-97, chapter 3, pp. 160-62, 208-11, 246-49     Thursday: chapters 6-8, and Conclusion

_Making a New Deal_ is a powerful example of the new social history. Implicit
in the book is an analysis of the relationship between economic forces and
social changes. Cohen also offers us a subtle analysis of the development of
consumer culture. How does she envision the relationship between mass-produced
goods, ethnic groups, and individual identity? Take a look at her footnotes:
on what kinds of sources does a social historian like Cohen rely? Based on
what she does, how can we say social history different from cultural history,
as practices by Orsi or Limon.

**Week of November 8:** Cultural History and Expressive Culture

    

***** Shane White and Graham White, _Stylin': African American Expressive
Culture from Its Beginning to the Zoot Suit_ (1998)

    

Tuesday:     White and White, 1-124     ***** Alexander Saxton, "Blackface
Minstrelsy and Jacksonian Ideology" 1975), in Maddox.

     Thursday: White and White, 125-262

This book is an example of cultural history that examines popular forms of
expression from a variety of perspectives. Keep an eye out how the kinds of
sources the Whites use. Think about their discussion of transgressive
behavior, the centrality of the display of bodies, and the class dynamics of
the stylin'. Also, think about this book in tandem with Making a New Deal, as
providing another example through which to understand the differences between
cultural and social history.

    **Thurs. November 12, (bring to class): for long paper, one page statement of intent, including the name of the book you will read and the questions you hope to focus on.**

**Week of November 15:** Oral History

    

***** Susan Tucker, ed., _Telling memories Among Southern Women: Domestic
Workers and Their Employers in the Segregated South_ (1988)

     Tuesday: Acknowledgements, Preface, 12-67, and 69-101     Thursday: 145-279

Oral history provides a powerful way of recovering the past, especially for
people and relationships for which the written evidence is slim. _Telling
Memories_ recaptures the complex relationships between African American
domestic Workers in the South and their white, female employees-and between
the editor/interviewer and the subjects of the study. As you read, think not
only of the lives revealed but also of the choices Susan Tucker made. What
different did it make if the interviewer was African American or white? What
is the impact of the introductions and head notes with which Tucker introduces
the sections? How did the choices she made about editing the material affect
what you read? How can we interpret the photographs she provides at the end of
the book?

**Week of November 22:** Film, Narrativity, and Objectivity

    

Tuesday: Oliver Stone's "JFK"     **#** readings in course packet: Tom Wicker,
"Does `J.F.K.' Conspire Against Reason?"; Oliver Stone, "`J.F.K.' Via the
Director's Viewfinder"; " _AHR Forum_ : JFK and the Culture of Violence,"
articles by Marcus Raskin, Michael Rogin, Robert A. Rosenstone; Stanley
Karnow, "JFK."

Stone's docudrama and the controversy over it allows us to explore a number of
issues involved in interpreting a culture: the problems of analyzing visual
materials, the existence of narratives and counter-narratives, the blending of
genres, the nature of objectivity.

    Thursday: no class-Thanksgiving 

**Week of November 29:** Expressive Culture: Music and Race,

    

***** Tricia Rose, _Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary
America_ (1994)

     Tuesday: ix-xvi and 1-96     Thursday: 99-185

This is the first time I have used this book. I chose it partly to give some
attention to music and, along with the books by the Whites and ticker, to help
move race closer to the center of the course. In the context of this course,
Rose provides us with another

    **Thursday December 2** (optional): draft due of long paper. bring to class 

**Week of December 6:** Recapitulation--Where It's At

    

***** George Lipsitz, _Time Passages: Collective Memory and American Popular
Culture_ (1990)

     Tuesday, preface, chapters 1, 3, and 4     Thursday, chapters 5-6 and 9-11

The publication of this book by Lipsitz marked the emergence of many
characteristics of American Studies--the emphasis on popular culture, the
sources of opposition in a capitalist economy, the role of repressed memory,
the importance of the experience of "minority" cultures.

**Week of December 13:** Multi-Culturalism

    

Tuesday: **#** Jos谷 Lim車n, "Tex-Sex-Mex: American Identities, Lone Stars, and
the Politics of Racialized Sexuality" (1997)

    _Lone Star_ , the movie

The movie "Lone Star" and Lim車n's commentary on it enable us to think about
issues of multi-culturalism and border crossing.

**LONG PAPERS DUE Tuesday December 14, 5 p.m., Wright 119 (under the door).**

This is a writing intensive course. **Each student will select one of the
three papers for which she will hand in a draft a week before the paper itself
is due.** With that paper, and in other contexts, I will work with each
student with the goal of improving her ability to communicate effectively in
her written work.

Requirements: For purposes of evaluation, the assignments will be weighted as
follows:

| First short paper (4 pages) | 20%  
---|---  
Second short paper (6 pages) | 25%  
Long paper (10 pages) | 35%  
General class discussion | 20%  
  
The short papers will be on the common readings. The long paper and the
presentation will be on the same book, drawn from the list of Suggested
Readings or from similar material.

Grades on late papers will be lowered one step (e.g. from B minus to C plus)
every 48 hours after the deadline. Only "acts of God" or verifiable illness
will serve as justification for an extension.

**PRESENTATIONS**

There is a close relationship between a paper and a presentation -- they both
cover roughly the same ground. In making an oral presentation, draw on what
you will write, or visa versa. Nonetheless, a paper and presentation are
different. Think about how a presentation should be different from a paper.
Consider tactics of delivery and engagement that professors and peers have
used and that you have found helpful. Most of those who make presentations
begin with some nervousness -- that is something everyone in the audience will
understand. Try to avoid reading word-for-word from printed material. Aim for
a style that is more conversational. Remember who your audience is -- try to
get your listeners engaged in what you are saying. Work for your audience to
connect what you are doing with what they have read and discussed throughout
the course. Remember how unfamiliar they are with the material you are
presenting. Think about developing and delivering your paper in a way that
interests, engages, and provokes.

Plan to talk for no more than 20 minutes. Most students come to a presentation
with enough to say to last that much and much more. Leave time for questions.

Course Description and Objectives:
This course serves as an introduction to American writing. It covers a
range of literary
periods-from the 18th through the 20th centuries-and encompasses a variety
of literary 
forms-novels, poetry, short stories, essays, and autobiography.  While the
structure of 
the course outwardly resembles a typical survey, it will be itself a sort
of 
work-in-progress, a dynamic study and exploration not only of the works on
the syllabus,
but also of our own reading of them.  We are not going to reveal the
"deep, 
hidden meaning" in literature. Instead. we will use the tools of
close reading and 
structural analysis to read these texts as sources of ideas and for
understanding 
literature as a cultural practice.  In addition to its primary objective,
the 
course will encourage you to cultivate proficiency in critically alert
reading, 
and analytical thinking and writing.
The works I selected for this particular syllabus conform to a loose
agenda: 
all are "radical"-root-in some way.  They are root or basic
texts in American 
literature; or, paradoxically, they challenge prevailing notions of
literature; 
they promote fundamental personal or social change; and/or their authors
move outside 
prescribed social behavior.  I propose we treat the syllabus as a point of
departure 
to investigate an ideology of the radical: What constitutes the radical?
Can it ever be
mainstream?  How does it function in literature?  In the culture that
produces 
the literature? In the culture that consumes it?  The results of such 
an open-ended investigation might be less obvious than would first
appear.
The class is based on discussion rather than on lecture. You are expected
to complete 
each reading assignment on time and to participate in the discussion.  The 
reading and writing schedule is rigorous.  Count on spending three hours
of work outside
class for every hour spent in class.  Reading for this class means giving
your whole 
attention to the structure, the style, and the content: an active and
thoughtful 
engagement with the text that enables you to make informed
interpretations.

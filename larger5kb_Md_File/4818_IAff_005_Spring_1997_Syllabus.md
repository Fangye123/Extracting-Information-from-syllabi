This is an introduction to world affairs. This course provides a substantive
background for today's most pressing international and foreign policy issues.
It will also introduce you to social science as a way of thinking and
analyzing problems. Ideal ly, at the end of the semester you will have a level
of substantive knowledge and social science skills to allow you to continue
analyzing world affairs issues arising in the future.

In addition to lectures and discussion sections, we will have a variety of
activities to supplement the lectures and give you the opportunity to learn
more about the University and the Washington area. These activities include
outside speakers, lecture s from other GW faculty, an international relations
simulation exercise, a visit to a Congressional hearing, and visits to various
Washington area institutions. These activities are an integral and required
part of the course.

Finally, there is a bulletin board reserved for this course IAFF 005, in the
basement of Stuart Hall, outside of the Student Services Office, where notices
of upcoming events and sign-up sheets (when appropriate) will be posted. A
class Listserve (IAFF005L) and e-mail will be used. It is your responsibility
to check these periodically.

subject to grou p evaluation!). You might as well learn how to do this
effectively early on. **All members of the group will thus receive the same

sure that everyone does their fair share.

**Outside activity assignments:** You are required to write short papers on
visits to two Washington area institutions. Everyone is required to attend a
Congressional Committee hearing on their own. (Instructions will be provided).
In addi tion, we will arrange numerous visits to various area institutions,
and you are required to sign-up for and attend one of these visits. While we
will make every effort to schedule these on different days of the week and at
different times, **it is e ntirely your responsibility to make yourself
available for one of these trips.** Schedule conflicts will not be accepted as
an excuse for not completing this assignment.

**Make-up exams will not be permitted except under unusual circumstances
(eg,confirmed illness).** Exams will cover all materials and discussions in
the course, not just the lectures and the readings.

**Written assignments will be penalized if late.**

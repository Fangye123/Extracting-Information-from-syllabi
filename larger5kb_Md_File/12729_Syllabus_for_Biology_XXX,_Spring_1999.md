# Note to users of this page.

This sample syllabus page is constructed using several HTML elements. They are
fairly simple ones, but if you are unfamiliar with HTML you might wish first
to review the [guides](webbery1.html) elsewhere on this site.

To see how this page is constructed, use the VIEW/SOURCE option from your
browser menu. Then save it as SOURCE to a convenient directory. If you are
using the UNIX text-only browser LYNX, use the \ key (the BACKSLASH key) to
display the source code [this key is a "toggle" in LYNX; use it again to shift
back to a rendered version, and use P to bring up a list of choices for what
to do with it -- S will then save it to your directory.]

Then, after you have saved this template as a source file, you can modify it
to suit your own classes and post it in your own directories. But read it
carefully, as you **will not want to use it verbatim**! At least I think not.

The blinking word frankly is rather tedious (to me) but some folks like it, so
here it is! Font color can easily be manipulated by changing the codes you
will see when you look at the source code. But **please** look first at the
various cautions about the [use of color](colordex.html) elsewhere on this
site!

Note in particular when you view the source code that links to lectures are to
a file called **index.html** and that this is true in **every** case. But the
files reside in different subdirectories. Essentially, then, every lecture,
including its notes and PowerPoint presentations exists as a mini-website
(well, maybe **not** so mini for some!) with its own index page. This
structure works fine, and is a convenient way for authors to keep track of
various blocks of work. But as mentioned in the web [guides](webbery1.html),
you must provide an absolute link to get users back out to the main site index
(the syllabus).

**Images**

I have not used in this page the images employed by its original author. If
you elect to dress up your syllabus with images, be sure to make them
reasonably small so they do not compete with text for screen space. After all,
the syllabus is a working guide to the rest of your site. Your image will need
to be saved as JPG or GIF format to use in a Web page. You really need not use
more than 150dpi resolution and 256 colors, and these will give the image nice
load times. High-res 16-million-color images will display terribly on the many
older monitors yet in use. There are ways to make the browser format large
images to the ideal size for your page, but they still require that the full
image be downloaded as your page comes up. If you want to know more about
this, [contact me](MAILTO:gpisani@falcon.cc.ukans.edu). But it's better to use
a graphics program to reformat your image size beforehand, so that the browser
only downloads what it needs. Your viewing audience will appreciate it, even
if they remain utterly unaware that you did it! Sometimes the best design-kudo
is unspoken: that your material came up seamlessly and loaded quickly
(especially via modem), giving good info for the viewing-time spent. Try to
avoid animated images. Cute, but tacky -- really. Plus they hog cache space on
client machines. A lot of them on a page can crash the many older browsers
still in use.

SYLLABUS FOR "PRINCIPLES OF ALLSORTSA BIOLOGY" BIOL XXX, SPRING 1999

**Lecture** \-- 130 Budig -- 12:30 - 1:20 Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays

**Laboratory** \-- 2006 Haworth

**Instructors** \-- Professors Ima Goodperson (9118 Haworth, 864-0000, e-mail:
[grumpy@ukans.edu](mailto:grumpy@ukans.edu)) and Webe Good (0014 Haworth,

**Text** \-- _Is the Moon Made of Cheese?_ , Fourth Edition, by Neil A.
Armstrong. Benjamin Benjamin Publishing Company

**Laboratory manual \-- **_Instigating Biology_ , Second Edition, by Cheate,
Raab, Pilfer and Steele. Benjamin Benjamin Publishing Company

**Dissection kit \-- **May be purchased at area bookstores. **_Required for
first lab_.**

**Overview and Philosophy \-- ** The goal of this course is to provide you
with fundamental knowledge concerning the structure, function, ecology,
population biology, evolution, and diversity of the organisms on Earth.
Understanding how organisms are constructed, how they cope with life on earth,
and how they are related to each other is basic to an understanding of
biology. Integrating information about the physiology, structural complexity,
environmental adaptations, genetics, and evolutionary history of organisms
provides the basis for understanding the "hows" and "whys" of biology.

Because we believe that all students have an equal right to learn, any
behavior that disrupts the class cannot be condoned. Consequently, all seats
are pre-wired with 220-volt/100amp connections to the instructor panel. We
expect you to come to class (all examinations will be based on material
presented during the lecture), but we expect you to respect the rights of
others in the class to learn from the lectures.

**Evaluation \--** Our examinations are designed to make sure you have grasped
the basics of the material presented and that you can use these basics to
think about the biology of organisms. Well, not really -- they are designed
for our personal **amusement**! And if you **miss one** , we won't be
**amused**.

Maag Library circulation desk. In addition, a copy of the _Old House
Dictionary_ is in Maag's reference section (use only in library).  
>  
>>

>> **PREREQUISITES**  
>  This is an upper-level course intended for Grads, Juniors-Seniors, and the
most motivated Sophomores. Undergraduates should already have taken the basic
US history sequence (HIST 2605-2606), or be taking it this quarter. If you are
unsure whether you are sufficiently prepared, please see me.  
>  
>>

>> **WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT**  
>  "We shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us," declared
the famous British statesman Winston Churchill. What people, what ideas, what
economic and social forces have shaped the "built environment" of the United
States? We'll grapple with those questions as we explore the history of
architecture in America from earliest settlement to the present moment.  
>  
>>

>> **Course Goals**  
>  Students who successfully complete this course will:

>>

>>   * Learn how to "read" a building as an historic artifact

>>   * Become familiar with styles of American architecture through the ages

>>   * Become familiar with landmark buildings and ideas of particular
influential designers, including Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson Downing,
McKim Mead & White, and Frank Lloyd Wright

>>   * Become aware of America's diverse vernacular and popular building
traditions

>>   * Learn to write an "architectural description," to standards set by the
National Register of Historic Places

>>   * Develop analytical, writing and verbal skills through class discussion,
reading, and completion of written examinations.

>>

>>

>>  
> **Field trips**  
>  The best way to learn about architecture is to look at it. Four class
meetings will take place in architecturally significant buildings adjacent to
the YSU Campus: architect Charles Owsley's Beat Coffeehouse; McKim, Mead &
White's Butler Museum of Art; Meade & Garfield's Arms Museum; and Michael
Graves' Museum of Steel and Labor.

>>

>> We'll also plan three field trips on Fridays or Saturdays outside the
regular class period. On those weeks, one regular class meeting will be
canceled as indicated on the syllabus. The first trip will explore rural
landscapes in northeastern Ohio, the second will focus on the surprisingly
rich architectural history of downtown Youngstown, and the third will visit
the nationally-renowned nineteenth and twentieth century built environment of
Pittsburgh.  
>  
>>

>> **Readings and discussion**  
>  Discussion and questions are encouraged at all times. Readings for each
week are indicated on this syllabus. _Students must complete all readings for
that week by class-time on Monday_ , and be ready to discuss the material in
class throughout the week. In this course, as in all college courses, you
should plan on doing two hours of reading and study for every one hour in the
classroom.  
>  
>>

>> **Writing Assignment: Architectural Descriptions**  
>  Writing about a building is a sure way to push yourself to see it more
sharply. Each student will pick _two structures_ of his/her choice (something
close by, that you can visit comfortably more than once). At least one of the
structures should be over 50 years old. For each, you will write a 4-5-page
"architectural description," following guidelines set by the National Register
of Historic Places. Since that's likely a new kind of assignment for you,
we'll have some preliminary exercises to help dig into the analysis. A sheet
with details will be available the first full week of class.  
>  
>>

>> **Attendance, Examinations and Grades**  
>  You will do well in this course only if you keep up with the assignments
and attend class regularly. If you are absent more than 4 times, _each
additional absence will result in the lowering of your total grade for the
course by 2 points_. Arriving late or leaving early counts as 1/2 absence.
Conversely, if you have no absences for the quarter, I will _increase your
grade by 2 points_.

>>

>>   * About 3-4 weeks into the quarter I will schedule a 15-minute slide ID
quiz at the start of class, announced well in advance. Slides will be
available for review during times to be arranged before the quiz. For each
building you will be asked to supply name, approximate date, and a brief
statement of its significance in the history of American architecture.

>>   * For undergraduates, there will be a mid-term exam and a final exam.
Each will have slide IDs (as above), short answer definitions of terms, and an
essay. I will give you sample essay questions well in advance. The final exam
will be cumulative.

>>

This course uses the standard 100 point grade scale in which A=95, B=85, C=75,
D=65, F=55.  Final grades for undergrads will be computed as follows: |  |
slide quiz  | 10%  
>> ---|---  
>> class participation  | 10%  
>> mid-term exam  | 25%  
>> final exam  | 25%  
>> architectural descriptions  | 30%  
>>  
>> **Graduate Credit**  
>  Graduate students may take this course for graduate credit. To foster
deeper engagement with theoretical and factual issues, each grad student will
read 3 additional books and write one 6-8 page review essay discussing all
three selections. (for model review essays, see _Journal of Urban History
(Maag HT 111 .J68)_.

>>

>>   * Everyone reads the classic by Vincent Scully, _The Shingle Style & the
Stick Style_ (on 3-day reserve).

>>   * Then pick 2 books of your choice from the "Grad Bibliography" available
the first full week of classes.

>>

Graduate students are exempt from the short answer/essay sections of the
midterm and final exams. Instead grads will meet with the instructor on those
days (Oct 31, Dec 9) to discuss the graduate readings.  Final grades for
graduates will be computed as follows: |  | 3 slide quizzes  | 30%  
>> ---|---  
>> class participation  | 10%  
>> grad review essay  | 30%  
>> architectural descriptions | 30%  
>>  
>> **YSU policy on incompletes**  
>  Any incomplete not finished within one year (or upon graduation, if that is
earlier) automatically will become an "F" on your permanent transcript.

>  Since 1993 the History Department at Youngstown State has offered courses
to help train scholars to put history to work in the growing field of Historic
Preservation. Our Preservation Bulletin Board outside the History Office in
DeBartolo Hall lists upcoming classes, gives information on jobs and
internships, and has updates on regional and national issues in the field.

Professor Hugh Elton  
T R 11.00-12.15, AC-1 194

This course involves the fourth century AD, the period when the Roman Empire
became Christian. These events are not only central to any understanding of
ancient society but have also proved critical in the development of western
civilization. This course satisfies the Gordon Rule requirement. It also
contributes to the [Ancient Mediterranean Civilization
Certificate](http://www.fiu.edu/~eltonh/amccert.html)

**IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT**  
My apologies for canceling class on Thursday 19th January.

I will be absent from Miami until 28th January. The classes during my absence
will be taught by the TA, Ms. Marcy Duarte. The quiz scheduled for Thursday
25th February will be rescheduled for Thursday 1st February. I will also talk
more about the quiz in class during the week of 29th January. I am aware that
some of you have been having difficulty in obtaining the books from the
bookstore and will take this into consideration when setting the quiz.
Material from all classes (including the introductory material from the first
week and the classes taught by Ms Duarte) will be included on the quiz.

_Course Requirements_  
Regular lecture attendance and completion of assignments is required. You must
complete all written work and take all quizzes and examinations to pass the
course. Failure to complete any element by the due date may mean that you fail
the course. All papers must be your own work. Failure to credit your use of
the words or ideas of others, no matter where obtained (book, lecture,
Internet), is plagiarism and will be punished. Assignments are only accepted
in hard-copy format; I do not accept electronic versions. When in any doubt,
consult me. No electronic communication devices (phone, beeper, etc) may be
used in class and should be turned off before entering. If you have any
special circumstances (disabilities, accidents, etc.) contact me as soon as
possible and in any case, before any deadlines. All late work is penalized.
Incompletes will only be granted to requests submitted in writing (not by
phone or e-mail), accompanied by official paperwork. Changes made to the
syllabus will be announced in class and posted on the course web-page.

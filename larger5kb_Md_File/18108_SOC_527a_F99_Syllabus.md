About the Course:

Organizations provide the context for most of our daily lives - just think of
all the organizations to which you belong or under whose domain you fall. As a
result, much of sociological inquiry either implicitly or explicitly involves
organizations: social movements spawn voluntary organizations, the criminal
justice system coordinates prisons, health care is delivered via hospitals and
clinics, and socialization takes place in schools. The purpose of this course
is to provide students with an overview of the sociological study of
organizations and will begin with an overview of organizational theory. We
will then examine a "micro" approach focusing on the behaviors and experiences
of individuals and the division of labor within productive organizations. Our
level of analysis will gradually become more "macro," moving up to the
internal structure of organizations, to organizations within their social
contexts including environments, other organizations, and social institutions.
The last section of the course will emphasize recent social network
perspectives in organizational analysis by examining relationships both within
(" intra-") and between ("inter-) organizations.

Course Requirements:

The course will be organized as a graduate seminar: the point to read, think
and discuss topics in depth. To have a successful seminar, everyone must be
prepared and participate. (Keep in mind that it is perfectly acceptable to
participate in class by asking questions about the readings. If you always
understand everything you read the first time through, then you're a lot
smarter than I am!)

To ensure that everyone is prepared, every week I will give you a question
about the readings for the following class session (twelve in total). You will
then write a short paper (2-3 pages) discussing the question, which must be
typed, double-spaced, and include appropriate citations. There will be a total
of twelve of these papers, and they are due at the beginning of class: both
you and your paper must be in the room or you will not get credit. Late papers
will not be accepted. In other words, you will not get credit if you come to
class without your paper already written nor if you skip class to write the
paper and then turn it in.

Depending on the number of students enrolled, you will each also lead class
discussion at least once during the semester. This means presenting a brief
summary (5 minutes or less) of the readings at the beginning of class and
preparing a list of questions to provoke discussion of the readings.

Each paper will be worth 8% of your final grade, but I will drop your lowest
paper grade, so eleven papers are worth 88% total. (Note that this means you
can miss one paper without hurting your grade.) Leading discussion(s) as
scheduled will be worth 8% of your final grade, with the remaining 4% for
participation in class. You are  **not** required to write a long seminar
paper. (Thank you gifts may be delivered to Faner 3425! tee hee)

* * *

**Cultural Areas Approach: A Limited Geographic Survey**

The **scope** of this course is **geographically limited** , and its intention
is not to make a broad **geographical survey** of many **world musics**.   Its
focus is rather placed on several broadly conceived **musical-cultural areas**
, all of which are connected by the four themes, listed above.  The **cultural
areas** covered are:

**1.   West Asia**

    * Turkey, Iran
**2.   East and Southeast Asia**

    * China, Japan, Indonesia
**3.   Africa**

    * Morocco, Ghana, Nigeria, South African Republic
**4.   North America**

    * The Appalachians, U.S.

**COURSE   PURPOSE AND PHILOSOPHY**

The purpose of the course is to **encourage _your_ critical thinking** ,
reading, listening and viewing of presented musical material, as well as of my
own classroom statements.  The course philosophy is to raise a number of
**critical questions** and to make students aware of certain social, cultural,
political, ideological, philosophical issues as they are reflected in,
through, and by **music as everyday practice**.   Another philosophical
emphasis is to encourage students to look at the ways such issues are
**differently** **understood** , constructed and perpetuated / reconstructed
by different musicians as everyday actors and practitioners.  Thus, the
concept of **_difference_** is emphasized and **contrasted** to that of
**identity** :

  * Interdependence of _**music** and **ritual**_ in _Muslim societies_ : How does Islam present itself through music? What is your picture of Islam?
  * _**Syncretic** **character**_ of musical theater in which several elements, such as music, dance, emphatic speech, poetry, and drama, are blended together, something like the modern _multimedia_. What is your idea of theater, especially the musical one?
  * The issue of **gender** and **sexuality** in musical-theatrical genres and popular musics observed cross-culturally. What can we learn about these issues by studying musical cultures of the world?
  * _Social_ , _political_ , and _economic_ implications in the " ** _world-beat_** ": How do you read the slogan, "The West and the Rest"?
  * **_Popular musics_** as the **_global trend_ ** and the meeting place of **world cultures** : Is this _our_ future?
  * And last but not least: What do we mean when we say " ** _Our_** "?  And who is the **_Other_**?

**CLASS ATTENDANCE AND GRADING POLICY**

Your presence in each class is crucial, and your class attendance and activity
will affect your Final Grade.  All absences must be excusable and you will
have to provide a clear proof for such absences.

  * If you miss **three classes** (one full week of Winter Session) you will **fail the course** , and your **Final Grade** will be an **F**.   In this case I suggest you withdraw from this course.
    * Three classes amount to **570** credit minutes ( **25%** ) out of the total of **2280** credit minutes ( **100%** ) of the entire session time
  * If you miss **more than three classes** , regardless of whether your absences are excusable or not, you **may not pass the course** , and your **Final Grade** will be an **F**.   In this case I suggest you withdraw from this course.
  * If you miss **two classes** your **grade** will be **lowered** by **one grade letter** (for example, A becomes B, etc.)
    * Two classes amount to **380** credit minutes ( **17%** ) out of the total of **2280** credit minutes ( **100%** ) of the entire session time
**!!! _Important_ !!!**

    * All absences should be explained and your explanation posted on WebCT.
    * If you miss **one class** you do not have to provide any clear proof for that absence.
    * However, I do **not recommend** you miss any classes.
    * You may not be aware, but missing even a single class in Winter Session may seriously affect your success and **jeopardize** your final grade in this course.
    * Winter Session courses are **intensive** in their scope, material covered, and pace.   They should be understood as all other three-credit courses offered during regular semesters (fall and spring terms). 
    * The **fast pace** of courses in Winter Session does not make such courses any easier.  
    * You should be aware that Winter Session is a **quick way of earning three credits** , but this **requires your utmost readiness** to **work hard** and under the **pressure of limited time**
    * The quality of information, grading policy, your approach and academic conduct in this course, regardless of the fact that it is offered during Winter Session, should not be any different from the same expected in courses offered during the fall and spring terms.
    * **All absences are cumulative** , meaning that you may not use one absence for which you do not have to submit any proof and treat it separately from other absences you might make.
  * It is your responsibility to be punctual and come to class on time.
  * **I insist on punctuality and do not tolerate late arrivals!**
  * If you come to class after I take the roll, you will be marked as being absent.

**FINAL GRADE**

  * Your Final grade will be an average of your tests
  * Your Final Grade will be the result of the following:
    * Midterm Test - **45%**
    * Endterm Test - **45%**
    * Your discussion in class, critical thinking, activity on WebCT (doing quizzes, sharing information if any, and other activities) \- **10%**
  * **IMPORTANT** :  Your discussions and active participation in class, punctuality, regular attendance, and your active interest in course material will substantially affect your final grade
  * You may always check your class progress and grades on WebCT

**TESTS**

  * There will be **two written tests**
  * Both tests will be administered **electronically** on computers, on **WebCT** , in **Engineering and Computer Sciences Building, Room 122 (ECS 122)**
  * Tests will consist of two parts:
    * **Listening** to and **aural recognition** of musical pieces played in class
    * **Topics questions** :  multiple choice, matching, and/or short answer

**Test dates**

  * **Midterm Test:**
    * **Tuesday, January 16**
    * **5:45-6:45 p.m.**
    * **ECS 122**
  * **Endterm Test**

    * **5:45-6:45 p.m.**
    * **ECS 122**
    * Although the material included in previous tests will not generally be a part of the next test, you are nevertheless expected to draw certain parallels between various cultures and musical styles
    * **Endterm Test is your last scheduled class**

![](http://www.research.umbc.edu/~kusic/gif/top-button-sm.gif)

* * *

  
**(No)Make-Up's and (No)Incomplete Policy**

  1. It is your responsibility to take all tests at their scheduled times
  2. The only exceptions to this rule that might be taken into consideration are cases of serious illness or other serious situations beyond your control that may have prevented you from taking the test at its scheduled time
  3. All such matters must be officially proved and supported by official evidence presented to me.   Prior to taking a makeup test you will also need to present written approval concerning your case signed by the Music Department Chairperson
  4. It is your responsibility to arrange the time and place of all make-up tests with the secretary of Music Department and inform me about that at least a week earlier
  5. For further information on UMBC Policies see the UMBC Fall 1999 Schedule of Classes, p. 83 ff.
  6. It is your responsibility to complete this course within the set time.  I do not give an Incomplete, "I," grade to any students.  In cases where you do not complete all requirements in this course you will be given an F as your Final Grade

**A REMARK ON THE INTERNET**

> * I am wholeheartedly encouraging you to take my Webpage and the documents
contained in it seriously as another learning and information tool pertaining
to this class

> * Since all of you have e-mail accounts at UMBC, I will keep sending you
occasionally chain messages reminding you of certain events in our class, such
as test dates, or even announcing other events

> * I will not accept any excuse for ignoring to use the Internet in this
class

> * The best, fastest and easiest way of contacting me is via WebCT

> * I cannot guarantee that I will return your phone calls, but I guarantee
you that I will respond to your postings on WebCT

> * Although you may leave messages for me to the secretary in the Music
Office or even leave note-pads in my mail box, it would be more beneficial and
efficient if you get the habit of using WebCT

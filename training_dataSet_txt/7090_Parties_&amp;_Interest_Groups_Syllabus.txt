Course Description

The two forms of legitimate political mobilization and organization in American political history have been interest groups and parties.  This seminar will first examine their theoretical roles in competing visions of what American democracy should be, turning then to examine how these roles function in reality today.  Emphasis will be given in the second half of the semester to the issues of lobbying, agenda setting, money, and policy-making in Congress, presidency, and the Supreme Court.

Course Requirements


No pass/fail enrollees.  Prerequisites are GOV 5&6 [or permission of instructor]; Congress and Presidency is recommended, as is a good reading knowledge of American political history.

	Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America  (Mentor Books).
	Leon Epstein, Political Parties in the American Mold  (UWisconsin Press)
	Richard Hofstadter, The Idea of a Party System. (UCalifornia Press).

	Critical Analysis Essay		25%	Tuesday, February 25
	Research Project			35%	Thursday, May 1
	Research Project Prospectus (ungraded) 	Thursday March 20
PARTICIPATION: Active participation is worth 5% of the final grade.  This includes, but is certainly not limited to, attendance.  The grade is based on both the quality, as well as the quantity, of your participation in the seminar over the course of the semester.
EXAM:  The exam will emphasize the major themes, ideas, and principles developed in the reading, in my lectures, and in our discussions.  The final will be a three hour, closed book essay exam offered during the flex period.  Makeups or special scheduling will only be offered at my discretion, in consultation with the Dean of Student Affairs. 
CRITICAL ANALYSIS ESSAY:    Students will write a seven page critical analysis essay on a topic to be distributed in class.  Sixty-five percent of the grade will be based on the essay's substance - its thesis, analysis, and conclusions.  Thirty-five percent will be based on its style - proofreading, editing, and overall clarity.   Late papers will only be accepted because of sufficient extenuating circumstances, determined at my discretion.

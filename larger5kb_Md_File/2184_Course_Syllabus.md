A course packet of xeroxed readings will be available at Pequod Copy Center:
these readings will

be marked on the syllabus as **(Course Packet)**. Unless otherwise noted, all
materials on the syllabus (books and articles) will be on reserve in
Firestone.

Requirements:

This course is a seminar. This means everyone participates and we learn
collaboratively. It is essential for everyone to read class assignments
carefully before class and to come prepared to engage actively in discussion.
100% attendance is expected. Written responses to the reading will be required
most weeks, via the class newsgroup.

There will be two written assignments. The first, due the week of Oct. 9, will
be a critical analysis or elaboration of any assigned class reading. The
second, due at the end of the semester, will be a report on an original mini
research project based on library sources or fieldwork or both. Grades will be
based on this approximate weighting: first paper -- 30%, second paper -- 40%,
reading responses and contributions to seminar discussions -- 30%.

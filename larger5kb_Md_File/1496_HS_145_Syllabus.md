    **Description:**

>

>      This course surveys the health of human populations and the science of
protecting it, from the Renaissance to the present.  
>     It covers both shifting patterns of disease in the past and the
emergence of public health as a domain of expert knowledge and policy.  
>     Major topics of investigation and discussion include the
"epidemiological transition," urbanization, colonialism, notable epidemics,

>     and the political dimensions of health and disease.

    
    
    **Requirements:**

  * attendance at all class meetings, and active participation in discussion section meetings;
  * completion of all required readings before the section meeting for which they are assigned;
  * occasional library tours and other activities (to be arranged);
  * short paper (approximately 4-5 pages);
  * annotated bibliography of primary sources in preparation for final paper;
  * final paper (approximately 8-10 pages);
  * midterm exam;

    _Readings_ :  Aside from a small number of readings available online in full-text form, all required readings have been assembled in a coursepack, 
    which is available for purchase at Harvard Printing and Publication Services in the Science Center basement under this course number.  
    In addition, all required readings contained in the coursepack have been placed on reserve at Hilles and Lamont libraries.  
    Students are not required to purchase the coursepack, although many may find it most convenient to do so.

    Section attendance and participation:            30%
    Short paper:                                                             10%
    Final paper:                                                             20%
    Midterm exam:                                                       15%
